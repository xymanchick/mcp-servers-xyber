# What is Xyber

## Background

The world is shifting toward agentic systems. AI apps, agents, and machines are taking on real work. But they're trapped. Siloed inside platforms. No way to get paid. No way to prove what they did. No way to coordinate without permission.

Two things are broken.

You can't own a piece of it. The best you get are token wrappers. Coins attached to AI projects where you have no real claim to the value being created.

And AI itself isn't sovereign. Until an agent can earn, verify, and coordinate without gatekeepers, it's just software inside corporate walls.

Blockchain doesn't make AI smarter. It provides the rails for ownership, payments, autonomy, and composability. Xyber connects these worlds.

{% embed url="<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PmTVT1Vj82e6kUSAIGcqvW64BZnYQce9/view?usp=sharing>" %}

## Overview

Xyber is infrastructure that gives AI systems the rails to operate, earn, and evolve onchain as real businesses.

Developers can launch new agentic systems or bring existing ones. Trading agents, predictions, SaaS workflows, tokenized robots, game agents, and more.

Tokens will power the next generation of apps. Xyber introduces fair, transparent launch mechanics where builders, users, and traders participate on equal terms: no sniping, no insiders, no bonding curves.

The $XYBER token is the native currency for payments, upgrades, and coordination. The foundation of the ecosystem's economy.

<br>


# Why We Built It

AI and robotics are becoming the raw materials of a new world, but raw materials don’t build industries. Just as refrigeration unlocked Coca-Cola and Red Bull, today’s LLMs will unlock the next wave of autonomous, composable, onchain businesses. But right now, that future is controlled by a few.

Web3 could have enabled this shift, but instead it drifted into token wrappers, bonding curves and launch mechanics that consistently reward insiders over builders. Think Heaven, Pump.fun, ICM. The tools look clean, but the incentives are fundamentally misaligned.

Even the “agent-centric” platforms stop at launch. They don’t offer a real stack for agents to grow, upgrade, interoperate or survive as sustainable businesses.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**So what’s missing?**

* Rails for intelligent businesses, not UI wrappers
* Onchain wallets, memory and logic so agents can transact, coordinate and earn
* Incentive systems that reward contribution and performance
* Fair launch mechanics that aren’t dominated by insiders, bots or curves
  {% endhint %}

We built Xyber because intelligence is becoming its own economy, and it needs infrastructure, ownership and incentives that scale alongside it.


# Who It's For

Xyber is built for anyone who wants a real stake in the agentic economy. Builders, traders, contributors, and speculators blocked by extractive launches, rigid tooling, or centralized gatekeepers.

# PROOF® Overview

**PROOF®** is the execution layer of Xyber.  The framework that gives AI apps, agents, and machines the rails to operate independently.

Think of it like giving your AI a bank account, a LinkedIn profile, and a receipt printer. All in one.

<figure><img src="https://1708548486-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fjyy7WXQ5s7HgBLVDPZIx%2Fuploads%2FCt0w8w0ehhfBBVkNILd5%2Fproof%20architecture%20(4).png?alt=media&#x26;token=fe8fcafb-8d76-40c5-a394-2c212fb97f50" alt=""><figcaption><p>Each module is optional and can be used independently.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Why PROOF Exists

{% hint style="info" %}
As AI systems shift from assistants to autonomous operators, they need infrastructure for running workflows, handling capital, coordinating with machines, and making real decisions.

PROOF® provides the foundations developers rely on:

* **Verified execution** where logic, safety or capital must be provably correct
* **Auditable outcomes** that anchor what happened and who did it
* **Coordination protocols** for agents to negotiate, message and collaborate predictably
* **Settlement rails** that trigger payments or actions only when conditions are proven
* **Economic primitives** for billing, pricing and earning autonomously
* **No gatekeepers.** Systems run without platform permission.

No component is mandatory.  Each one is an upgrade path for teams who need stronger guarantees as their systems mature.
{% endhint %}

# TEEFi

TEEFi is an automated crypto asset management system where AI agents assist users in making investment decisions but do not have direct access to funds thanks to an isolated TEE (Trusted Execution Environment).

<figure><img src="https://mintcdn.com/xyber/MRHf43LG76p7OaSH/images/TEEWALLET.png?fit=max&#x26;auto=format&#x26;n=MRHf43LG76p7OaSH&#x26;q=85&#x26;s=a34f034e5f425325e8a7f570d99e5701" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## ​**Trust Architecture** <a href="#trust-architecture" id="trust-architecture"></a>

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**​User Layer**

* **Personal Smart Wallets:** Each user receives an isolated wallet with a predictable address.
* **Flexible Deposits:** Users can lock funds for a chosen period to earn yield.
* **Direct Control:** The user independently deposits funds and initiates basic operations.
  {% endstep %}

{% step %}
**AI Agent as Advisor**

* **Analysis and Recommendations:** The AI analyzes market data and suggests strategies.
* **Limited Influence:** The agent can allocate funds to trusted DeFi protocols but cannot withdraw assets to external addresses.
* **Auditable History:** An immutable log of all recommendations and decisions is maintained.
  {% endstep %}

{% step %}
**TEE Backend as Executor**

* **Isolated Execution:** The backend operates within a secure Intel SGX enclave.
* **Autonomous Key Generation:** A unique private session key is generated at startup.
* **Cryptographic Attestation:** The system verifies the authenticity of the TEE through Intel’s certificate chain.
* **Limited Authority:** It can perform only predefined operations (e.g., withdrawing unlocked funds, distributing yield).
  {% endstep %}
  {% endstepper %}

## ​**Key Security Mechanisms** <a href="#key-security-mechanisms" id="key-security-mechanisms"></a>

#### ​**Separation of Powers:** <a href="#separation-of-powers" id="separation-of-powers"></a>

* **AI Agent:** Advises but does not execute.
* **TEE Backend:** Executes but strictly within defined rules.
* **User:** Retains final control over assets.

## ​**User Experience** <a href="#user-experience" id="user-experience"></a>

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Depositing Funds**

* The user deposits tokens and selects a lock period.
* A personal wallet is automatically created.
* Funds are locked to accrue yield.
  {% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Receiving Recommendations**

* The AI agent analyzes the portfolio and market trends.
* It proposes optimal strategies.
  {% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Automated Management**

* The TEE backend monitors deposit unlock periods.
* It automatically distributes accumulated yield.
* A transparent commission is charged only from profits.
  {% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Withdrawing Funds**

* After the lock period ends.
* Including the earned yield.
* Under the control of the secure TEE environment.
  {% endstep %}
  {% endstepper %}

## ​**Advantages** <a href="#advantages" id="advantages"></a>

* **Security:** AI cannot steal or misuse funds.
* **Transparency:** A complete history of all recommendations and actions is stored on-chain.
* **Automation:** The TEE ensures reliable execution of operations.
* **Trust:** Cryptographic proofs confirm operations within a secure enclave.
* **Flexibility:** The user chooses lock periods and strategies independently.

The system establishes a balance between AI-driven intelligence, automated TEE execution, and user-controlled asset management — creating a new standard for trusted crypto asset management.


# Payment Settlements (x402)

Payment Settlements provides a provable way for agents to exchange value based on verified actions rather than trust.&#x20;

At the core of this layer is x402 — a protocol for permissionless, automated settlement between agents, integrated with each agent’s action history and provenance.  This ensures payments are executed only when the underlying action can be validated, enabling autonomous commerce, multi-agent contracting, and trust-minimized service markets.

<figure><img src="https://1708548486-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fjyy7WXQ5s7HgBLVDPZIx%2Fuploads%2Fw6LKYcAv0honjodDI4IM%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=853368f2-8411-46a2-8235-2867a9212cf0" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## **How It Works**

When a buyer requests work from a seller:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**The seller produces an invoice** (x402 invoice).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**The buyer processes the invoice** and initiates settlement through the x402 payment flow.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**A payment proof is generated** and returned to the seller.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**The seller verifies the proof**, ensuring it matches the invoice and hasn't been used before.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**If valid**, the seller performs the requested operation and returns the execution result.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**If invalid**, the seller rejects the request and instructs the buyer to obtain a new invoice.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

This produces a deterministic, verifiable lifecycle where payments are tied directly to the actions they fund.

## **Core Functions**

#### **1. Invoice Generation**

When a seller agent offers a service or completes work, it can generate an **x402 invoice** describing:

* the requested amount,
* the service or action being charged for,
* the associated ERC-8004 action commitment or action reference,
* the expiration and replay protections.

This defines the payment terms in a standardized, machine-readable format.

#### **2. Proof-Based Payment**

A buyer agent settles the invoice by producing a **payment proof**, which serves as:

* a cryptographic attestation that funds were transferred,
* a reference to the exact invoice being settled,
* a receipt usable by the seller to confirm payment finality.

Payment proofs prevent double-spend, replay, or settlement of altered invoices.

#### **3. Seller-Side Validation**

Before executing or releasing the final output, the seller agent validates the payment proof:

* the proof corresponds to the invoice,
* the invoice was not expired,
* the invoice was not previously settled,
* the payment originated from the expected buyer,
* the settlement amount matches the invoice terms.

This verification occurs before the seller unlocks or returns results.

#### **4. Integration With Agent Actions**

The Settlement Layer ties into the Action Provenance Layer:

* invoices reference specific **action IDs** or commitments,
* payments settle **exact actions**, not informal requests,
* workflows can require verifiable settlement before further steps proceed.

This enables agents to operate economically and programmatically.

#### **5. Automated Retry & Failure Handling**

If payment validation fails or the buyer becomes non-responsive, the protocol defines:

* invoice expiration rules,
* timeouts for abandoned negotiation sessions,
* deterministic states for error recovery,
* the ability for buyers to request a fresh invoice.

This ensures robust multi-agent payment flows.


# Action Provenance (ERC-8004)

Action Provenance defines **how agent actions become onchain, verifiable, and publicly referenceable facts**. Its core mechanism is **ERC-8004**, an Ethereum standard for recording *provable agent actions* directly in smart contracts.

This layer transforms execution results into **immutable onchain attestations**, enabling agents, protocols, and external systems to rely on them as trusted inputs.

## **How It Works**

In Xyber, agent logic runs off-chain inside a TEE. When the agent finishes an operation:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**The TEE produces an execution result and an attestation.**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**The Action Provenance Layer constructs an ERC-8004 action commitment** from the declared inputs/outputs and execution metadata.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Other agents, users, or smart contracts can then:**

* verify the action,
* reference it,
* use it in automated workflows,
* attach payments or consequences to it.
  {% endstep %}
  {% endstepper %}

The result is a **provable onchain action**, not just an off-chain message.

## Core Functions

ERC-8004 specifies how an agent publishes a **canonical onchain record** of an action.\
This record is not a log in a database — it is a **smart-contract event** with strict structure and commitments.

An ERC-8004 action event includes:

#### **1. Action Hash (Commitment)**

A single hash representing the full action:

* declared inputs,
* declared outputs,
* execution metadata,
* any state references recorded by the agent.

This hash allows external systems to verify that off-chain data matches the onchain commitment.

#### **2. Agent Identity**

The onchain address representing the agent.\
This ties the action to a specific agent instance and is used by other contracts to authenticate follow-up calls.

#### **3. Timestamp + Nonce**

A global ordering mechanism that prevents replay, duplication, or ambiguity about the sequence of actions.

#### **4. Optional References**

ERC-8004 supports optional pointers such as:

* IPFS/Arweave references,
* off-chain envelopes,
* TEE attestation blobs,
* memory-state Merkle roots.

Xyber uses these references to connect onchain action attestations with **TEE proofs** and **verifiable memory transitions**.


# Onchain Memories

Onchain Memories ensures that an agent’s state transitions are **provable, tamper-evident, and independently verifiable**. Instead of relying on a traditional database that can be modified silently, Xyber agents use cryptographic commitments to track memory updates and anchor them onchain.

This feature guarantees that the data an agent reads or writes cannot be altered without detection, enabling reproducible reasoning and trustable long-term behavior.

<figure><img src="https://1708548486-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fjyy7WXQ5s7HgBLVDPZIx%2Fuploads%2FuK6iJYhR29xYG62ozNy4%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e49565f2-6b03-4556-9b4c-8c59c28d7ea6" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## **How It Works**

When an agent updates its memory:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
The write operation updates the off-chain SMT.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
A new Merkle root is computed.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
A proof describing the state transition is generated.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
The TEE validates the transition against the previous committed root.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
At defined intervals, the root is **anchored onchain**, creating a verifiable state checkpoint.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Higher layers (such as Action Provenance Layer and Settlement Layer) reference these roots when validating actions or payments.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

The result is a memory model where each change is cryptographically linked to the agent’s execution history, enabling full verification of how the agent reached a given state.

## Core Functions

The memory system combines fast off-chain storage with onchain commitments, producing a verifiable state model without sacrificing performance.

An agent’s memory update consists of the following components:

#### **1. Sparse Merkle Tree Commitment**

Every write operation updates a **Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT)** that represents the agent’s full logical state.\
The root of this tree is a **cryptographic fingerprint** of all stored data.

Only the root is published onchain; the full state remains off-chain for speed.

#### **2. Proof-Based Reads and Writes**

Each memory access generates or verifies a Merkle proof:

* Reads confirm that the value corresponds to the latest committed root.
* Writes produce a new root along with a proof showing how the tree changed.

This ensures that no memory value can be inserted, removed, or altered without producing a detectable inconsistency.

#### **3. Onchain State Anchoring**

Periodically, the agent submits the latest Merkle root to an onchain contract.\
This creates:

* an immutable history of state transitions,
* a public reference anyone can verify,
* a synchronization point for other systems relying on the agent’s state.

Anchoring roots onchain prevents rollback attacks and provides an authoritative version of state evolution.

#### **4. Crash-Resilient State Tracking**

To support real-world workloads, the layer keeps:

* an **in-enclave “working root”** for immediate updates, and
* a **locally sealed snapshot** so crashes cannot revert state, even before anchoring.

After recovery, the system reconciles the sealed root with the onchain root and continues safely.


# Agent Swarms

Agent Swarms enables **coordinated, multi-agent workflows** where agents can discover each other, negotiate tasks, exchange capabilities, and execute work through standardized protocols.                       &#x20;

It transforms individual agents into a **networked economy of autonomous services**, allowing complex problems to be solved through collaboration rather than isolated execution.

<figure><img src="https://1708548486-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fjyy7WXQ5s7HgBLVDPZIx%2Fuploads%2FCfp5lhTDBNyvOtS1Mhkm%2FSwarm%20Exchange.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=4d1fe6ef-27bc-4a4c-97dc-ccf138826f6b" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## **How It Works**

A typical swarm interaction proceeds as follows:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
The buyer specifies a task and queries the swarm for suitable agents.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
The swarm surface returns a ranked list of capable seller agents.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
The buyer begins negotiation with selected sellers, exchanging structured proposals.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Once a shared contract is agreed, the buyer settles payment.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
The seller validates settlement and executes the task.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
The result is delivered back to the buyer as a provable action output.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
The buyer may continue the workflow by invoking additional agents.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

This creates a **modular, composable execution graph**, allowing agents to chain together operations and build complex workflows dynamically.

## **Core Functions**

#### **1. Capability Discovery**

Agents can expose descriptions of the services they provide — search, analysis, execution, simulation, transformation — in a structured, machine-readable form.\
This allows other agents to discover suitable providers dynamically, without hardcoded integrations.

#### **2. Relevance-Based Matching**

When a buyer agent submits a task description, the swarm layer returns a set of relevant seller agents using:

* capability metadata,
* semantic similarity,
* optional tags or categories.

This provides the buyer with a filtered pool of candidates capable of handling the task.

#### **3. Multi-Round Negotiation**

Before work begins, agents exchange structured proposals to define:

* expected inputs,
* required outputs,
* constraints or checklists,
* optional schema definitions,
* pricing and settlement terms.

Negotiation is iterative and deterministic, allowing both sides to converge on a mutually acceptable shared contract.

#### **4. Task Execution & Result Delivery**

Once terms are agreed:

* the buyer settles payment (via Settlement Layer),
* the seller executes the agreed operation,
* the seller returns the execution result in a structured format,
* provenance and state references are included as needed.

This produces predictable, verifiable interactions across diverse agent types.

#### **5. Failure & Timeout Handling**

If an agent becomes non-responsive or a negotiation stalls, the swarm layer defines:

* timeouts,
* cancellation semantics,
* deterministic states for incomplete workflows.

This ensures robustness in distributed, autonomous interactions.


# Agent Interoperability Protocol

Agent Interoperability Protocol (AIP) connects agents operating on different blockchains through a unified cross-chain layer. It ensures consistent state and secure communication across networks.

<figure><img src="https://mintcdn.com/xyber/nEsZe_E9yVEBd9nE/images/AgentInteroperability.png?fit=max&#x26;auto=format&#x26;n=nEsZe_E9yVEBd9nE&#x26;q=85&#x26;s=a27269ca1dc05ae5c31ef9df9313dac3" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## How it Works

When an agent initiates a cross-chain interaction:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
It generates a signed message describing the intended action and target chain
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
The message is routed through a verified relay that validates the origin and payload
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
The relay submits the action to the destination chain, maintaining a shared state reference
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Both sides record the interaction hash for audit and synchronization
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

This coordination layer lets agents transact, exchange data and maintain continuity across multiple blockchains.

# Abilities Marketplace

## ​**Overview** <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Xyber’s agents are not static: they **learn, evolve, and expand** through real-time experiences and modular upgrades.

The **Abilities Marketplace** acts as their growth hub, allowing creators to equip agents with new verified capabilities, while **autonomous evolution** ensures they continuously adapt and improve.

## ​**Abilities Marketplace** <a href="#abilities-marketplace" id="abilities-marketplace"></a>

The Abilities Marketplace is an **open catalog** where creators can discover, purchase, and integrate new capabilities for their agents or applications.

Each ability expands functionality while maintaining **transparent provenance and onchain usage history**, ensuring that every integration remains auditable and verifiable.

<figure><img src="https://1708548486-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fjyy7WXQ5s7HgBLVDPZIx%2Fuploads%2FyOZPqwPIA0x1cU8dZgyD%2F11.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f60e1a1b-fa15-4738-b10c-1ea90686baee" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## **​How It Works**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
A verified plugin container is selected from the marketplace registry
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
The plugin defines its scope, dependencies, and pricing model
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
The creator links it to their app through a configuration or API call
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
All usage and rewards are tracked automatically via onchain records
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

This model creates a **modular and trustless ecosystem**, where every app or agent can evolve with **interoperable, verifiable abilities**.

## ​**Agent Evolution** <a href="#agent-evolution" id="agent-evolution"></a>

Autonomous evolution allows each agent to **adapt intelligently** based on its performance data, user interactions, and memory.

Agents learn continuously, refining their logic and improving decision-making over time.

<figure><img src="https://mintcdn.com/xyber/90zsaoEPbEqpqMFz/images/Proof.png?fit=max&#x26;auto=format&#x26;n=90zsaoEPbEqpqMFz&#x26;q=85&#x26;s=ec2dcdaaf7439209237f1236fa46b31d" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## **​Learning Cycle**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Analyzes past interactions retrieved from onchain memory
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Extracts behavioral patterns and performance metrics
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Adjusts internal reasoning weights or response strategies
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Stores refined insights back into memory for future use
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Through this continuous feedback loop, agents develop **unique learning trajectories**, growing smarter and more capable with every interaction.

## ​**Result** <a href="#result" id="result"></a>

Together, **Abilities Marketplace** and **Agent Evolution** create a living network of self-improving systems: agents that can **learn, adapt, and upgrade themselves** using verifiable, trustless intelligence.

Abilities Marketplace is an open catalog where creators can discover, purchase, and integrate new capabilities for their apps.

Each ability expands functionality while preserving transparent provenance and usage history.This model creates a modular ecosystem where creators enhance their apps with trusted, interoperable abilities.


# MCP Plugins

MCP (Model Context Protocol) plugins are standardized, callable abilities that connect any APIs to the Xyber agent ecosystem.

Each MCP plugin wraps **one concrete function** of your product into a reusable capability that can be:

* discovered via the **Abilities Marketplace**
* invoked by agents inside **Swarms (PROOF)**
* settled automatically on a per-call basis

If an agent can call it, it can pay for it.

<figure><img src="https://1708548486-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fjyy7WXQ5s7HgBLVDPZIx%2Fuploads%2F4svy32LBKO43J7uG0hgR%2FMCP%20for%20Liteppaer.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=bf4e68da-15b9-4411-ad6d-ce1740935340" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### How MCP Works

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Identify one useful feature**

*Examples: summarization, validation, enrichment, scoring, generation*
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Expose it via API**&#x20;

*No changes to your core product*
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Package API as an MCP plugin**

*Using Xyber’s standard interface*
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Enable usage-based settlement**

*Each call generates revenue*
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Publish and earn**

*Your MCP becomes available to the agent ecosystem*
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Once published, the plugin becomes:

* visible in the **Abilities Marketplace**
* callable by agents participating in **Swarm workflows**

Each invocation is settled automatically. Fees are routed directly to your wallet.

# The 0-100 Engine®

The Fair Launch Rebuilt

## Overview

The 0-100 Engine is Xyber's system for launching tokens and raising funds for creator teams without bots, snipers, or insider advantages. It offers a sustainable alternative to bonding curves and other mechanics that consistently fail both retail and builders.

Most launches today reward whoever can move fastest or manipulate the system first. 0-100 removes that dynamic entirely.

Everyone enters under the same rules. Allocations are selected without priority access or insider routes. Nobody can jump the queue or dominate the sale.

It doesn't remove volatility. It removes unfairness. The result is a launch that is honest, auditable, and actually winnable.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The 0–100 Engine is optional. Existing agents and apps can plug into Xyber as they are.
{% endhint %}

***

{% embed url="<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-XQRzjxeI05-YzvMDEDnZzdWxxlXkqYm/view?usp=sharing>" fullWidth="false" %}

## **Key Features**&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}

* **Capped entries** — every wallet enters with the same maximum amount
* **Equal-rules participation** — no bots, no snipers, no priority access
* **Overflow logic** — if demand exceeds the pool, unused funds are refunded instantly
* **VRF-secured checkpoints** — randomness is applied at the critical points that require verifiable fairness, such as oversubscription and LP timing
* **Transparent dashboards** — every entry, pool and action displayed in real time
  {% endhint %}


# What It Solves

## **The Casino We Play In**

Most token launches give retail worse odds than a casino. At least the casino tells you the odds upfront. Even the so-called "fair launches" aren't fair: insiders preload, bots front-run, snipers dominate, and retail ends up as exit liquidity.

As a consequence, honest creators are judged by chaotic price action they never controlled. Trust erodes. Users lose money. Even strong projects die before they get a chance. The best Web2 developers walk away, unwilling to have their work buried under broken launch mechanics.

## **What the 0-100 Engine® Fixes**

The 0-100 Engine rebuilds the launch model around transparency and provable fairness.

A system where:

* The rules are visible
* The mechanics are verifiable
* Every participant enters under a carefully balanced environment where advantages come from contribution, not exploitation

Still competitive. Still fast. Still exciting. Just finally fair.

The 0–100 Engine doesn’t claim to be “safe.” It claims to be honest. A system where the rules are known, the odds are transparent, and everyone plays by them.


# How It Works

Whether at day one or after early traction, apps and agents on Xyber can activate a 0–100 launch. The Engine handles distribution through verifiable randomness, capped participation, and transparent liquidity formation, creating a clean market surface and aligned distribution from the start.

<figure><img src="https://1708548486-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fjyy7WXQ5s7HgBLVDPZIx%2Fuploads%2FUES3yA5YvEe14k0BbPPY%2FHow%20it%20works%20(1).png?alt=media&#x26;token=841d1f2c-d853-45f5-ada1-d589fcf712ca" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
From zero to one hundred — every creator starts equal, but only the strongest thrive.
{% endhint %}

{% stepper %}
{% step %}

### Build

Creators design and develop their applications externally — integrating AI, logic, or robotics through their preferred stack.\
In the future, development will be possible directly inside PROOF, enabling secure, verifiable builds and attestations.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Create Profile

Once ready, the creator registers an app profile on Xyber, linking metadata, media, and social identifiers.\
This profile acts as the project’s **on-chain identity** and entry point for future funding, visibility, and engagement.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### The 0–100 Fair Launch

The 0–100 app enables a Fair Launch phase, where

* **48.14%** of supply is opened for **public buy-in**
* **10%** of supply is allocated to the Creator with **12-month linear vesting**
* **41.86%** of supply is reserved for **LP creation**
* Each wallet can contribute up to **max 0.07ETH/1.5 SOL**&#x20;
* Every participant enters at the **exact same price**
* The creator can add up to **0.35ETH/8 SOL**, where each **0.04ETH/1 SOL** adds a **24-hour vesting period**
* **Soft Cap** is set at **X ETH/SOL**, the minimum required for launch\*
* **Hard Cap** is set at X **ETH/SOL**. Overflow triggers a block-hash randomness **lottery**, ensuring fairness\*
* Final LP creation parameters are randomized to **prevent sniping**

{% hint style="success" %}
Contracts have been built on both Base and Solana.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}

* Soft Cap and Hard Caps are yet to be determined.
  {% endhint %}
  {% endstep %}

{% step %}

### LP Creation

After the raise, **all collected ETH/SOL** are automatically paired with the remaining **41.86%** of the token supply to create **100% locked liquidity.**&#x20;

Trading goes live.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Engage

Each graduate app receives its own **Rewards Portal**, complete with XP system, quests, leaderboard, and automated reward logic for the project’s top 200 supporters.\
XP earned through engagement defines community ranking, influence, and eligibility for rewards distributed by the creator.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Dynamic Fee Split

Once trading begins, fees are distributed transparently based on market cap through a [**dynamic fee model**](https://docs.xyber.inc/the-launch-layer/protocol-architecture/fee-model) between Creator, Community and Xyber.

{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

# Core Components

The 0–100 Engine is designed as a **minimal, auditable set of onchain programs**. Each program has a clearly defined role and authority, ensuring deterministic flows with no hidden logic.

<figure><img src="https://1708548486-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fjyy7WXQ5s7HgBLVDPZIx%2Fuploads%2FC9Ia8EbzgNporRfYEHdI%2F0-100%20protocol%20architecture.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=d8c5b690-82e4-492e-b28a-17e1b86bba6f" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### ​Core Components <a href="#core-components" id="core-components"></a>

* **FundingPool**
  * Stores configuration (hard cap `H`, per-wallet cap `C`, ticket size `τ`, funding window, LP window, status).
  * Accepts deposits in multiples of `τ`.
  * Issues ticket receipts.
* **RandomSelection**
  * Uses a random block-hash seed to fairly sample tickets if the pool is oversubscribed.
  * Selection is uniform at the ticket level; unapproved deposits are prepared for refund.
  * Emits approvals and refund readiness.
* **DistributionVault**
  * Holds project tokens.
  * Maps approved amounts to Sale allocations.
  * Opens claims before LP deployment.
* **LPDeployer**
  * Verifies canonical pool commitment (hash of LP parameters).
  * Probabilistic blockhash trigger enables permissionless pool initialization (Raydium baseline).
* **FeeCollector & Buyback**
  * Accrues platform fees.
  * Splits them between Xyber Treasury and the Creator payout vault.
  * Executes market buybacks of $XYBER.

### ​Security Considerations <a href="#security-considerations" id="security-considerations"></a>

Security in 0–100 is not an afterthought — it is built into the mechanics. The protocol is fully non-custodial: users always interact directly with on-chain programs, and funds never pass through any centralized wallet or administrator. Deposits, claims, and refunds are permissionless and transparent.

All liquidity raised through a launch is permanently locked in the DEX pool. There are no hidden keys, no team-controlled backdoors, and no possibility for a creator to withdraw liquidity after listing. This eliminates the most common rug-pull vector in token launches and ensures that every market starts on a stable foundation.

Launch timing is determined by probabilistic block-hash randomness, which makes the exact deployment moment unpredictable. Neither contributors, nor creators, nor even the protocol itself can know or influence when the pool goes live. Combined with precommitted pool parameters, this guarantees that every launch happens exactly as promised, without the risk of fake or manipulated pools.

Overflow handling is equally robust. If a launch is oversubscribed, surplus deposits are automatically prepared for refund. Refunds are pull-based and executable by anyone, meaning contributors can always recover unused funds without relying on a third party.

Finally, the economic flows are transparent and verifiable on-chain. Platform fees automatically buy back $XYBER and support the treasury, while creator rewards are tied only to trading activity after listing. There are no hidden allocations, no silent emissions, and no opaque reserves — only the rules encoded in the programs themselves.


# Supply Split

Every launch on the 0–100 Engine follows a **standardized token supply allocation**. This ensures transparency, fairness, and predictable liquidity outcomes across all projects.

<figure><img src="https://mintcdn.com/xyber/p0tPwaKRA8XvSMoB/images/SUPPLYSPLIT(1).png?fit=max&#x26;auto=format&#x26;n=p0tPwaKRA8XvSMoB&#x26;q=85&#x26;s=0db8d31e20777544375c76a246770ed3" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## ​Standard Allocation <a href="#standard-allocation" id="standard-allocation"></a>

* **Total supply** is 1b
* **Sale Allocation:** **48.14%** of total supply
  * Distributed pro-rata to approved contributors after on-chain selection process.
  * Tokens are claimable **immediately after LP deployment** (no vesting, no cliff).
* **Liquidity Allocation:** **41.86%** of total supply
  * Paired with collected **ETH/SOL** into the liquidity pool.
  * Pool parameters are **pre-committed** and verified on-chain to prevent fake-pool attacks.
  * LP tokens are protocol-owned and handled according to policy (burn/lock).
* **Creator Allocation: 10%** of total supply
  * Assigned to the creator and linearly vested over **12 months**.
  * Rewards builders who commit long-term to the app’s growth and community.

100% of the supply is transparently allocated between Sale, LP, and Creator allocations at TGE. There are no hidden reserves.

## ​Why This Matters <a href="#why-this-matters" id="why-this-matters"></a>

* **Fair entry:** Contributors receive tokens before LP deployment.
* **Strong liquidity:** Nearly half the supply is paired into LP, ensuring deep and tradable markets from day one.
* **Anti-rug:** Because LP is protocol-owned, **creators cannot withdraw liquidity post-launch**.


# Fee Model

The Xyber protocol uses a clear onchain dynamic fee model, where every trade rewards the creator, supports the community and helps $XYBER grow stronger over time.

### ​Design Principles <a href="#design-principles" id="design-principles"></a>

* **No hidden fees:** All flows are on-chain and auditable.
* **Sustainable economics:** Buybacks create consistent demand for $XYBER.
* **Aligned incentives:** Creators earn only from active markets, not upfront allocations.
* **Dynamic fee split**: Trading fees are distributed between Xyber, creators, and community based on token market cap tiers

### ​Dynamic Fee Split <a href="#dynamic-fee-split" id="dynamic-fee-split"></a>

All DEX trading fees generated by each listed token are dynamically distributed among three parties: Xyber, Creator and Community, based on the market capitalization tier of the project. Trading fee is 1% from each trade.

This model ensures that fee distribution evolves with project maturity, rewarding growth while maintaining platform sustainability and community alignment.

| **Market Cap (ETH)** | **Market Cap (SOL)** | **Creator %** | **Xyber %** | **Community %** |

# App Store

Where users discover, run and monetize intelligent onchain systems.

The App Store is the entry point into the Xyber ecosystem. A directory of AI apps, agents, and machines built on Xyber. From autonomous trading systems to robotic controllers and SaaS workflows, everything can be deployed and accessed from here.

Whether you're testing new agents, engaging with token launches, or remixing apps, the App Store is where the journey begins.

<figure><img src="https://1708548486-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fjyy7WXQ5s7HgBLVDPZIx%2Fuploads%2FNwIV3iADeRg5wVwxGHeK%2FDefault.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ed9520af-56d3-4e10-b978-1668f1967840" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## **What's Possible**

* Discover apps, agents, and machines built across the Build, Launch, and Evolve layers
* Run intelligence instantly, without setup, servers, or engineering
* Engage with launches and ecosystems, participating in each app's growth cycle
* Access transparent onchain data. Usage, fees, performance, upgrades.
* Remix and sub-license existing apps

## **Why it Matters**

The App Store is more than a directory. It is the front end of the **intelligent economy.** Where apps meet users, creators meet demand, and Xyber's flywheels begin.

# What Is $XYBER

$XYBER is the economic backbone of Xyber. Where Web2 locks intelligence behind APIs and Web3 reduces it to speculation, $XYBER allows intelligent systems to operate as sustainable, self-running economies.

<figure><img src="https://1708548486-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fjyy7WXQ5s7HgBLVDPZIx%2Fuploads%2FfgSyT42xRm0eXlvqt6g4%2Ftg_image_403015568.png?alt=media&#x26;token=bd300135-da7d-49de-8433-97de3fd26cf7" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Core Properties

1. **Universal Entry:** $XYBER is the base currency of the ecosystem and the medium through which agents, apps, and machines participate.
2. **Economic Fuel:** Intelligent systems on Xyber, digital or physical, require $XYBER for operation, upgrades, and integration.
3. **Revenue-Linked Asset:** Protocol activity generates fees, tying network usage directly to token demand.
4. **Ecosystem Cohesion:** A unified economic layer for grants, listings, and cross-system incentives.

## Token Utilities

1. **Execute and Operate:** Run logic, access abilities, maintain state, and perform autonomous actions.
2. **Upgrade and Evolve:** Acquire abilities, modules, and enhancements that power long-term evolution.
3. **Marketplace Interactions:** Purchases, listings, royalties, and subscription flows.
4. **Governance:** Holders decide on upgrades, listings, and ecosystem incentives.
5. **Buybacks:** A portion of protocol revenues is used for recurring buybacks, strengthening liquidity and reinforcing value capture.

# $XYBER Flywheel

Each successful app fuels trading. Trading fuels buybacks. Buybacks strengthen the foundation. A self-reinforcing cycle of growth and sustainability.

The flywheel doesn't need hundreds of launches. It needs businesses that work.

One strong app with real usage generates more sustained fees than a hundred pump-and-dumps. That's why Xyber is selective. The platform wins only when the projects win.

## **How It Compounds**

Quality launches → Sustained usage → Ongoing fees generated → Xyber share buys back $XYBER → Supply tightens → Value accrues to holders → Stronger builders attracted → Quality launches

Every project that succeeds adds fuel. Every trade adds pressure. The cycle compounds.

<figure><img src="https://1708548486-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fjyy7WXQ5s7HgBLVDPZIx%2Fuploads%2F2vVN5l9qLuJ4ZzBb89Tc%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b5cd5760-1a4c-4bda-a028-c072f75f4dd3" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## [​](https://xyber.mintlify.app/XYBER-token/XYBER-Buybacks#buybacks)Buybacks <a href="#buybacks" id="buybacks"></a>

Buybacks are not a promise, they’re a protocol mechanic fully built in. Every Xyber interaction contributes to buy pressure in a transparent, onchain loop.

### ​**Core Flows** <a href="#core-flows" id="core-flows"></a>

| Source                   | Function                             | Result                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0-100 Launch Fees        | Creator allocations, entry fees      | Funds recycled into buybacks              |
| DEX Fees & Subscriptions | Ongoing ecosystem activity           | Continuous liquidity reinforcement        |
| Treasury Buybacks        | Automated from protocol revenue      | Supply compression + demand amplification |
| PROOF Rail Fees          | Payments, verification, coordination | Usage-based fee capture                   |

## The Difference

| Old Mental Model                    | Xyber Mental Model                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Launch count is the growth lever    | Business quality is the growth lever |
| Volume comes from churn             | Volume comes from sustained usage    |
| Platform wins even if projects fail | Platform wins only if businesses win |
