# Introduction

The On-Chain Gateway To The Humanoid Age.

XMAQUINA is a community-driven ecosystem opening direct access to the rise of Physical AI.

While Physical AI races ahead, access to the companies building it has been limited to insiders. XMAQUINA gives the community a way in by co‑owning world‑leading humanoid robotics companies, key players in the robotics supply chain developing the building blocks of the future, and strategic Physical AI assets such as revenue‑generating machines operating in the real world.

### **AI is Reshaping the World**

AI is advancing rapidly, outperforming humans in tasks like reading, math, and software development. Once a tool to boost productivity, AI is now replacing workers in both office and manual roles. Humanoid robots from companies like Tesla and Figure are improving quickly and will soon surpass humans in manufacturing, logistics, construction, and household tasks. Jobs once considered safe are being automated.

Two forces are reshaping the economy: Digital AI taking over office work and Physical AI replacing manual labor. Some countries may resist, but others, like the U.S. and China, see automation as critical. China, for instance, needs robots to sustain its economy as its workforce ages and shrinks. This shift is inevitable.

### When Capital No Longer Needs Labor, How Does Labor Acquire Capital?

This question, posed by Emad Mostaque, the founder of Stability AI, is one of the most critical of our time. For centuries, economic balance relied on the relationship between labor and capital. Workers earned wages, allowing them to accumulate capital and become owners of the economic engine themselves. The relationship between capital and labor has always been complex, but there was always a relationship.

So what happens when labor is no longer needed?

When AI and robots handle most of the work, how will people stay connected to the economy? Machines will be able to work tirelessly and efficiently, humans will have a hard time competing. XMAQUINA believes the solution is giving people exposure to the technologies driving this change.

### This Is Why XMAQUINA Exists

XMAQUINA is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with a clear mission: to give its members a real stake in the Humanoid Age. Instead of being sidelined, we are taking charge by securing access to the companies and systems shaping tomorrow.

Automation is moving fast, and its direction is clear. XMAQUINA brings together people who see what is coming and gives them a stake in shaping and benefiting from it through the DAO.

Our foundation rests on three principles:

* **Co-ownership:** To hold a stake in the future, the DAO acquires positions in the most innovative and disruptive companies in the Physical AI space, including private firms developing advanced robotics and automation systems. These opportunities are typically closed to the public, but by pooling resources, we make them accessible to our community.
* **Co-creation:** Technology should not be controlled by a handful of corporations. We believe that open-source development is crucial to keeping innovation accessible and decentralized. Projects like DeepSeek demonstrate that open-source AI and robotics will play a major role in shaping the future, ensuring progress is not monopolized.
* **Co-governance:** Power should be shared, not concentrated. The DAO is governed collectively by its members, who stake the DEUS token to participate in decision-making. This ensures that critical choices are made transparently and democratically, rather than being dictated by a select few.


# The Rise of Physical AI

Bridging Intelligence and the Physical World.

## We Are Witnessing The Rise Of Physical AI

Physical AI refers to the integration of artificial intelligence into machines that can perceive, navigate, and interact with the physical world autonomously. This emerging field represents the fusion of robotics, advanced sensors, and agentic AI, creating systems capable of performing complex tasks in dynamic environments.

Unlike traditional AI confined to digital domains, Physical AI operates in the real world. These systems combine spatial awareness, real-world physics, and sensory data to adapt seamlessly to their surroundings. From humanoid robots to autonomous vehicles, Physical AI is unlocking new possibilities for machine autonomy and human-machine collaboration.\

## The Rise of Physical AI

The emergence of Physical AI is driven by rapid advancements in foundational technologies, which are converging to make autonomous machines more capable, affordable, and practical. Key pillars include:

* **Agentic AI**

  Unlike AI systems requiring constant human prompts, agentic AI operates independently. These autonomous systems are built to handle dynamic environments, make real-time decisions, and learn from their experiences. Reinforcement learning-based robots navigating complex spaces are a prime example of this evolution.
* **Robotics** \
  Mechanical innovation has made robots more agile, durable, and efficient. Advances in actuators, motors, and materials have reduced costs while improving functionality. Modular designs and economies of scale now make robotics accessible to smaller developers and startups, democratizing the field.
* **AI-Driven Hardware and Sensors** \
  Affordable, accurate sensors such as LiDAR are transforming perception capabilities. The cost of these technologies has plummeted from tens of thousands of dollars to a few hundred, while their accuracy has surged. These advancements enable Physical AI systems to model the environment with unparalleled precision.
* **World Foundation Models** \
  These AI models aim to replicate how humans perceive and understand their surroundings by integrating visual, auditory, and tactile data streams. By constructing comprehensive mental models of the physical world, these systems improve prediction, interpretation, and decision-making in real-time scenarios.

## **Training Physical AI Systems**

Training Physical AI requires robust approaches that balance simulation with real-world data:

* **Simulated Environments**\
  A common strategy is to build high-fidelity, physics-based virtual environments. Borrowing techniques from video game development, these environments simulate real-world conditions and generate synthetic data for training physical AI models. Once trained in virtual settings, these models can be deployed on physical machines. However, while synthetic environments are invaluable for initial training, they are often insufficient for preparing AI to handle the full range of real-world contexts.
* **Real-World Data**\
  Real-world environments provide the necessary edge cases and variability that simulations lack. Companies like Tesla rely on human-controlled environments to gather high-quality contextual data for systems like their Optimus robot. Such datasets are essential for refining models to handle the unexpected.

## **The Role of Decentralized Ecosystems in Physical AI**

A decentralized approach to data gathering is pivotal for advancing Physical AI. Unlike centralized systems, decentralized ecosystems offer greater flexibility, adaptability, and the ability to address niche use cases effectively. XMAQUINA can drive this innovation by empowering a collaborative community to collect diverse, high-quality datasets or by developing proprietary solutions through DEUS Labs.


# Decentralized Physical AI

The decentralized robotics ecosystem will bring together visionaries, futurists, technologists, to co-own, co-create, and co-govern the next generation of robotics.

The XMAQUINA ecosystem is about providing access to the rise of humanoid robotics by owning equity in the world’s most innovative companies driving this transformation. It enables a global hub of DAO members to collaborate.

At the core of XMAQUINA is the XMAQUINA DAO. The DAO strategically invests its treasury in high-impact ventures, including humanoid robotics, DePIN protocols, and Machine RWAs. Through community-driven governance, members collectively decide how to allocate the DAO’s treasury to maximize impact and equity ownership in future-defining companies.

Every allocation strengthens the DAO’s treasury with valuable assets, humanoid robotics companies, or protocol tokens, ensuring the ecosystem’s long-term growth, scalability, and influence in the robotics revolution.

## **A Decentralized Organization**&#x20;

The MachineDAO, a decentralized organization, is the engine powering XMAQUINA’s ecosystem, delivering on three vital fronts:

* **Resource Allocation**\
  Directing funds and assets to transformative robotics and AI projects
* **Value Management**\
  Channeling returns, be they tokens, or innovative assets, back into the DAO’s treasury to fuel further growth
* **Product Development**\
  Enabling collaboration among builders in Deus Labs to expand and provide value to the XMAQUINA ecosystem


# The XMAQUINA Thesis

Humanoid robotics will reshape the global economy, disrupt labor, redefine industries, and transform everyday life at a scale not seen since the internet.


# Humanoids: The Largest Market Opportunity of Our Time

Humanoid robotics will reshape the global economy, disrupt labor, redefine industries, and transform everyday life at a scale not seen since the internet.

We believe that humanoid robotics will be the most disruptive technology since the Internet. With humanoids, artificial agents will move beyond screens and servers to operate in the physical world. This marks the true arrival of Physical AI and it will reshape everything.

2025 is going to be a breakthrough year. As technological advancements in AI, battery systems, and scalable manufacturing processes converge, humanoid robots are a few years away from becoming mainstream. We will start seeing truly impressive wide-scale experiments this year. &#x20;

XMAQUINA envisions a future where humanoid robots become part of daily life. Enhancing productivity, improving safety, and raising quality of life across industries and households.

This transformative technology is too important to remain controlled by a handful of large corporations in a few countries. Given its inevitable military applications, it will become a strategic priority for sovereign nations to build their own ecosystems and solutions. Although this may lead to some degree of fragmentation, market dynamics are likely to gravitate toward a shared open-source foundation, much like how Android has become the dominant platform in the smartphone industry today.

XMAQUINA is committed to accelerating the development of this open-source core. By strategically backing key builders, we aim to shape the future of humanoid robotics and ensure our members benefit from the growth of this critical technology.

## Why Humanoid Robots?

<figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6763dfa8120b46189e3e1a35/679ad7aafc609ad509531f9d_AD_4nXco3qPVVA2Xjs39668ZUGpcH3eNk949jaJvHEIzakYgImvjzVq_6lyZu66H44IwkRLD8IkNuvfmJOyEU42YKg3PvCyqmb0bhlL_V4Xbdn8MIKeQIJrKwdLUI2UWL5gB4npI32FlFrGODen38VYYrw.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Given how popular culture has portrayed them, itʼs reasonable to ask why we persist in developing robots that resemble humans so closely. In movies like *Terminator* or *I,Robot*, the development of humanoid robots invariably leads to catastrophe. *Ex Machina* offers a more nuanced but equally cautionary tale. This modern exploration of artificial intelligence follows an android who manipulates the protagonist, ultimately breaking free and killing its creator.&#x20;

Given these dire science fiction scenarios, one might wonder: why do we continue pursuing robots that mirror human form?

**Brett Adcock, CEO of Figure, offers a very clear answer: our world has been built by humans, for humans, with every object optimized for the human form.**

Consider the domestic environment: a wheeled robot may struggle with something as simple as climbing stairs.  A quadrupedal robot could climb stairs , but neither is capable of operating human transportation modes such as bicycles or cars. These tools and machines fundamentally require a human form to function.

Our world is designed for beings with one head, two legs, and two hands. More specifically, the world is designed for the average adult human. Most objects are built for adults with average heights and average builds. Even among humans, the world is less accommodating to children, people with disabilities, or those outside average proportions. So, in order to work across both everyday and workplace environments, humanoid robots of average height and build will provide maximum utility.

Humans continue developing humanoid robots because they offer unparalleled versatility and utility, adapting to countless environments and tasks. They are truly the ultimate general purpose tool.

## Current Landscape

The past five years have seen remarkable progress in the area of artificial intelligence, agents, and humanoid robotics. While the advancements in AI have been widely publicized, the strides in the physical capabilities of humanoid robots are equally noteworthy: Tesla Optimus can now walk, climb hills, slide, and recover from falls; Toyotaʼs CUE6 earned a Guinness World Record for the "Longest basketball shot by a humanoid robot"; Figure F02 is undergoing tests in BMW manufacturing sites; and Boston Dynamicsʼ Atlas demonstrates impressive feats like dancing and performing backflips.

The 5 market leaders, right now, are Tesla, Figure, Apptronik, Agility Robotics, and Unitree. There are a number of upcoming start-ups innovating fast in the space, such as 1X Technologies, Agibot, Engineered Arts and countless others. Every one would deserve their own papers.  Letʼs explore some key players: **Figure, Tesla, Unitree,** and **1X.**

**Tesla**: Elon Musk has publicly stated that, in a few years, revenue from Optimus could surpass that of electric car sales. Itʼs not surprising that Tesla is heavily invested in this field, given its existing strengths such as:

* **Battery Technology**: Humanoid robots will be electric and will require high-performance and compact batteries, an area where Tesla already has a clear advantage.
* **AI and Environmental Perception**: Tesla has built a significant expertise in software and AI, particularly in environmental recognition through its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.&#x20;
* **Mass Production**: Tesla is one of the few companies on this list with proven large-scale manufacturing capabilities, which will be critical for scaling humanoid robots.

**Figure:** A relatively new startup led by Brett Adcock, which has made astonishing progress in a short time. Their robot stands out not only for its impressive technical performance but also for its elegant design. The level of care put into the robotʼs appearance makes it look like something Apple might have developed.

**Unitree**: The interest in humanoid robotics is not limited to the United States. **Unitree**, a Chinese company, has also made significant strides, especially with its quadruped robots. Unitree could be a game changer if they succeed in drastically reducing production costs, making robots more affordable and accessible.

**1X Technologies**: 1X Technologies is part-american, part Norwegian. It has developed a robot that resembles Teslaʼs Optimus but with much smoother movements. This robot is designed specifically for domestic use.

For companies like Figure and Tesla, the primary goal is to replace human workers, particularly in industrial environments where labor is essential but conditions can be hazardous. These robots are being designed to be extremely robust, with the long-term goal of operating in fully automated environments. At the initial stage, their purpose isnʼt necessarily to coexist with humans in everyday life.

On the other hand, **1X** differentiates itself with the ambition of creating a domestic robot. Every aspect of its design prioritizes seamless interaction with humans. For example, during demonstrations, the robot collaborates with a young woman, and certain parts of its body, where one might expect mechanical "muscles," have been thoughtfully designed to be soft, preventing injuries during repeated interactions. Every detail is optimized to ensure safe coexistence with humans.

Another impressive aspect of 1Xʼs work is their demonstration of tasks like serving coffee, as well as their ability to handle delicate operations. This level of precision and interaction sets a new standard for humanoid robotics.

## The Future Market

Humanoid robotics will be transformative, both economically and socially. Brett Adcock and Elon Musk highlight the enormous potential for humanoid robots to reshape the global economy, potentially creating a market that could rival or surpass todayʼs largest industries, such as energy and healthcare.&#x20;

With aging populations across developed countries and increasing pressure on labor markets due to a shrinking workforce, humanoid robots will become essential in addressing labor shortages and providing support for senior care.

### Market size

According to a report by [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/the-global-market-for-robots-could-reach-38-billion-by-2035?utm_source=chatgpt.com), the global market for humanoid robots is projected to reach **$38 billion by 2035**, driven by demand across industrial, commercial, and domestic sectors. Elon Musk has expressed that the Optimus robot could significantly impact the company's valuation, potentially making Tesla a $25 trillion company ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-shares-bold-prediction-162019324.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).) In one presentation, he claimed that “**this will be the biggest product everˮ** drawing parallels to the iPhone, which redefined personal technology and became one of the most successful products in history.

We believe that the **$38 billion estimate by Goldman Sachs is very conservative.** In 2024, the iPhone alone generated about **$200 billion** in revenue for Apple, accounting for nearly half of the companyʼs total revenue. It took many years to get there but by comparison, humanoid robots have the potential to transform multiple sectors simultaneously, from industrial automation and healthcare to domestic assistance, each of which representing multi-billion dollar markets on its own.

<figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6763dfa8120b46189e3e1a35/67bb955553a4bdb0fd2684f7_graphxmthesis.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Unlike the iPhone, which disrupted the consumer electronics market, humanoid robots could disrupt almost every market, including the labor market itself. As populations age and labor shortages become a growing issue, robots designed to support industrial operations and daily life could see exponential demand. Furthermore, advancements in AI, battery technology, and scalable manufacturing are accelerating the timeline for large-scale adoption, which could lead to a market size far beyond initial projections, sooner.

We are not the only ones thinking that the market will be much bigger than Goldman Sachs’ prediction. For instance, [ARK Invest](https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/how-ark-is-thinking-about-humanoid-robotics) forecasts a $24 trillion opportunity, driven by advancements in humanoid robots and their integration into various industries. Similarly, [Macquarie Research](https://www.invesco.com/content/dam/invesco/apac/en/pdf/insights/2024/may/invesco-china-a-shares-opportunities-in-the-humanoid-robot-supply-chain-may-2024.pdf) estimates the global market size for humanoid robots could reach $209 billion by 2035, with manufacturing volumes hitting 9.4 million units, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69% between 2025 and 2035.

### Impacted Sectors

#### **Industrial Automation**

Companies like Tesla and Figure are initially focusing on industrial environments where robots can replace human labor in repetitive, dangerous, or physically demanding tasks. In sectors such as manufacturing, logistics, and warehousing, humanoid robots could increase productivity dramatically while reducing costs.

#### **Healthcare and Elderly Care**

As the global population ages, there will be an increasing need for caregiving robots that can assist with routine tasks, mobility, and companionship for the elderly. Companies like 1X are well-positioned to address this market with their emphasis on safe, human-friendly design.

#### **Hospitality and Retail**

The hospitality industry, including hotels, restaurants, and entertainment, is another promising area for humanoid robots. These robots could handle customer service, cleaning, and food preparation tasks, enhancing efficiency and customer experience. In this sector, androids, humanoid robots with a human face, could play a bigger role.

#### **Domestic Assistance**

Humanoid robots designed for household tasks could become as common as household appliances. Tasks like cleaning, cooking, childcare, and pet care could be outsourced to robots designed for domestic environments.

#### Challenges to Overcome

While the outlook for humanoid robots is promising, several significant hurdles remain:

* **Cost**: Current prototypes are prohibitively expensive, and cost-effective mass production will be critical for mainstream adoption. Given the complexity of these machines—far beyond that of cars or computers—maintenance costs are expected to be substantial. Users and businesses may need to both purchase the robots upfront and subscribe to ongoing maintenance and support services. Although similar cost barriers have been overcome in markets like smartphones, this process will likely take years.
* **Public Acceptance**: Cultural resistance and fears of job displacement are inevitable during the rollout of humanoid robots. As with other disruptive technologies, initial skepticism is expected. However, we anticipate that these concerns will diminish as the tangible benefits begin to outweigh the perceived downsides.
* **Regulation**: One of the most significant barriers will be the establishment of regulatory frameworks to address safety, privacy, and ethical concerns. We expect that many governments will implement licensing systems akin to those for firearms or vehicles. Robots may need to display license plates and could be restricted from entering public spaces initially for safety reasons, confining their use to private domains such as offices and homes. Additionally, manufacturers and owners will likely face mandatory insurance requirements, further adding to the cost burden.

## Our Vision

<figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6763dfa8120b46189e3e1a35/67bb95a319662a7130151765_AD_4nXevAOCbiBNjhUhnsRSZ0egegDf4QtFcge1gLfpRCLjPsDgtKhIUd1GkwCvmvEHEHyBFrPnzPu0vASONoTfrOeVmIUCeZqMWzjrhD1m8NPeoSYOCZcF8ZFjywswhM1EGJ-cYMCaw9xsYolzZtkVluA.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We believe the humanoid robotics market will evolve in a way similar to the smartphone market, with two dominant models emerging:

1. **Appleʼs Full-Stack Model**: A vertically integrated approach where a single company controls both hardware and software, delivering a seamless and highly optimized user experience.
2. **Androidʼs Open Ecosystem**: A platform-driven model where an open-source operating system is adopted by multiple manufacturers, resulting in a diverse range of devices catering to different market segments and price points.<br>

Due to economies of scale and the complexity of humanoid robotics, we anticipate a similar dual-model dynamic in this industry, with a few full-stack players and a broad open ecosystem driving innovation and widespread adoption.

### **The Full-Stack Players**

We expect Tesla to adopt a full-stack approach by controlling the entire value chain—from hardware and AI software to post-deployment services. Teslaʼs expertise in large-scale manufacturing, advanced battery technology, and autonomous systems positions it to create tightly integrated products with superior performance and reliability. This approach would enable Tesla to dominate high-margin industrial and commercial markets, where customers are willing to pay a premium for comprehensive, well-integrated solutions.

Similar to Appleʼs position in the smartphone market, Tesla may capture a smaller share of total units sold but generate outsized profits by offering value-added services across the entire "problem space." These services could include software updates, predictive maintenance, and enhanced AI capabilities offered through subscription models. The ability to monetize both hardware and ongoing services would provide full-stack players with a significant competitive advantage in terms of profitability.

Tesla’s approach to humanoid robots may mirror their strategy for electric vehicles. In the EV space, Tesla leverages real-world data from its vast fleet to refine its autonomous driving systems, with the ultimate goal of achieving full self-driving capability. This process relies on human-driven data collection, which is then used to train models that eventually aim to eliminate the need for human input entirely.

Tesla’s key insight lies in recognizing the immense value of gathering large volumes of high-quality, application-specific data. We believe this data-driven methodology is equally crucial for advancing humanoid robots. Our thesis is that access to vast, real-world datasets will be a critical differentiator in developing highly capable and autonomous humanoid systems.

### **An Open and Fragmented Ecosystem**

In contrast, we anticipate that the broader industry will coalesce around a shared, open-source ecosystem built on a **Humanoid Robot Core (HRC)**. This core would include a standardized operating system and a suite of essential components, such as a foundational world model. By providing a common framework, the HRC would enable a diverse range of manufacturers to design and deploy robots with varying features, capabilities, and price points, catering to a wide array of market demands.

An open ecosystem would enable faster innovation by encouraging collaboration across a large community of developers and hardware manufacturers. Over time, this model would create a vibrant and diverse market, with specialized robots optimized for specific sectors such as healthcare, logistics, personal assistance, hospitality, security, and defense.

By allowing smaller manufacturers to focus on hardware without needing to develop a proprietary operating system, the open model would lower the barrier to entry and drive mass adoption. Similar to how Android allowed a broad range of handset makers to succeed, this approach would result in a wide variety of humanoid robots tailored for niche applications, ensuring broad use across industries and geographies.

Some industries, such as security and defense, are unlikely to accept dependence on a single full-stack provider like Tesla. Instead, they will demand dedicated, open-source, auditable systems developed by national providers under their control to ensure that critical functions remain sovereign and secure.

NVIDIA is working on open systems, and are likely to have a strategy to develop this HRC. It has introduced the concept of a "world foundation model" (WFM) with their Cosmos platform, for instance. These models are designed to understand the dynamics of the real world, including physics and spatial properties, enabling robots and autonomous vehicles to perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in physical environments.

‍

## **The Open Ecosystem Architecture**

The structure of this open ecosystem could follow a model similar to the **hourglass-shaped protocol stack** that forms the backbone of the TCP/IP architecture. This model is referred to as hourglass-shaped because it highlights the essential role of the **IP layer** as the narrow waist through which all communication flows.&#x20;

At the top, a broad range of **application-layer protocols** (such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP) operate, while at the bottom, various **network and link-layer protocols** (such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and LTE) handle connectivity. The **IP layer** in the middle acts as a universal, minimal interface, ensuring seamless interoperability across diverse technologies and applications.<br>

This hourglass structure has been key to the internetʼs scalability and success, enabling innovation and competition. It allowed a broad ecosystem of companies to flourish at the lower layers—such as **Cisco, Juniper Networks,** and other network hardware providers—while an even larger ecosystem developed at the upper layers, including major infrastructure and application providers like **Google, Facebook, and Amazon**, alongside millions of smaller developers and startups.

<figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6763dfa8120b46189e3e1a35/67bb9719c72f3fe8e851f8ee_xm2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Similarly, we believe that the open humanoid robot ecosystem will be structured around a narrow waist: a humanoid robot core, or HRC, composed of an operating system designed to work with a standardized “human bodyˮ form factor as the common denominator.

Below the HRC, we will likely find a few standardized “shared platformsˮ, a similar concept to what we can see in the automotive industry with the Volkswagen's MQB platform, the Toyota's TNGA platform or the Hyundai-Kia's N3 platform.&#x20;

‍

The MQB platform is used in models across multiple brands such as VW, Audi, Skoda, and SEAT. Below those shared platforms are the individual humanoid robot models, which differ significantly—from very basic to highly advanced androids—to serve various use cases.

\
Above the HRC, we would have capabilities and plug-ins, and above this middleware, we would find the application layer targeting a wide range of use cases. Some robots may be conversational, while others may remain silent, depending on their intended function.

‍

## Our Mission

XMAQUINAʼs mission is to accelerate the development of **open robotics ecosystems** and support the creation of a strong foundation for humanoid robot innovation.\
\
As a DAO, we can:

1. **Promote an Open-Source Humanoid Robot Core (OHRC)**: By supporting the development of a shared platform, we seek to create the foundation for a collaborative ecosystem where manufacturers can build specialized robots without needing to reinvent the software core. By advocating for open, auditable systems, we will help build trust in humanoid robotics. The support would be financial, community-driven, and strategic, ensuring that developers and manufacturers have the resources they need to succeed.‍
2. **Drive Standardization**: Establishing common standards for interoperability, safety, and performance will be critical for ensuring the long-term success of humanoid robotics. Our goal is to facilitate the creation of these standards through partnerships with industry leaders, governments, and research institutions. Standardization will enable seamless collaboration and integration across various robotics solutions.
3. **Support Specialized Innovation**: We believe that an open ecosystem will unlock innovation across countless niches—from personal assistance robots to advanced industrial automation. By providing a flexible and adaptable platform, we will enable new players to create robots tailored to unique use cases. Our role will be to identify high-potential projects and provide them with both funding and mentorship to bring their solutions to market.

## The Opportunity

Like with Android, there will be many winners in an open ecosystem. XMAQUINA aims to identify and support those potential winners.&#x20;

* **Core Operating System Developers:** Companies or projects working on the foundational HRC that can be adopted across the industry.
* **Specialized Hardware Providers:** Teams developing key components, such as advanced actuators, sensors, and lightweight materials, that will enable better humanoid robot performance.
* **Niche Application Innovators:** Startups focusing on specific applications, such as elder care robots, industrial inspection robots, or autonomous delivery robots, which could dominate their respective markets.
* **Tooling and Simulation Platforms:** Developers creating tools that aid in robot design, testing, and deployment, such as simulation environments or low-code platforms for robot programming.

By strategically investing in and supporting these key areas, XMAQUINA can help shape the future of humanoid robotics and ensure the success of an open ecosystem that benefits everyone.

## The Timing

There is no doubt in our mind that humanoid robotics is a transformative technology that will

happen. The real question is when will this become mainstream, i.e. when will this cross the chasm? Letʼs look at the two most recent personal hardware revolutions.<br>

* **The Personal Computer Revolution**: Personal computers began as niche tools for hobbyists. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, numerous brands with distinct ecosystems emerged, including 8-bit computers like the Apple II, Commodore 64, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum, followed by 16-bit systems such as the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. The market was fragmented, making it difficult to predict who would become the dominating players.\
  \
  The introduction of IBM's PC in 1981 with its open x86 computing architecture, led to the proliferation of IBM PC compatible systems, with a number of hardware manufacturers computing to offer the best value for the price. The release of Windows 95 in 1995 further solidified the dominance of the open x86 architecture, resulting in the current landscape dominated by Windows, macOS, and Linux (on the server side).<br>
* **The Mobile Phone Explosion**: The mobile phone market followed a similar trajectory. Initially, companies like Ericsson, Nokia, and Motorola dominated each offering devices with physical keyboards and proprietary operating systems. Then, the Blackberry was a disrupting device in the space with the introduction of true email mobility. Many thought that RIM would be the winner. The landscape shifted dramatically with the introduction of Apple's iPhone in 2007, featuring iOS, and the subsequent release of Google's Android operating system in 2008.\
  \
  In the years following the iPhone's debut, the smartphone market experienced exponential growth. By 2013, global smartphone shipments had surpassed 1 billion units annually, with Android and iOS devices accounting for the vast majority of these sales. The market has been stable with those two ecosystems still dominating the market, with no disruptor in sight.\ <br>

We can abstract this into four different phases:

1. **The Research Phase**: This is where the technology begins in labs and research institutions, often with limited commercial viability. For personal computers, this phase occurred during the 1960s and early 1970s, when computing was primarily a tool for large enterprises and universities. For mobile phones, this phase spanned from the 1970s through the early 1990s, with basic mobile communication devices being developed and tested.\
   ‍
2. **The Fragmentation/Explosion Phase**: This is the period when the technology enters the commercial market and numerous brands compete with different approaches and proprietary ecosystems. In personal computers, this phase was marked by the explosion of 8-bit and 16-bit platforms in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with brands like Apple, Commodore, and Atari. For mobile phones, this was the era dominated by Nokia, Motorola, Ericsson, and later BlackBerry, with each offering devices that were incompatible with one another. During this phase, it's difficult to predict which players will dominate long-term.\
   ‍
3. **The "Moment" Phase**: This is the turning point when a disruptor or a dominant standard emerges, transforming the market. For personal computers, this moment was the introduction of Windows 95, which established a unified software ecosystem around the x86 architecture. For mobile phones, this moment was the launch of the iPhone in 2007, which redefined the concept of a smartphone with its touch interface, app ecosystem, and seamless web browsing experience. Within a few years, Android and iOS emerged as the two dominant platforms, and the market was reshaped.\
   ‍
4. **The Consolidation Phase**: In this phase, the industry stabilizes around only two or three dominant ecosystems or standards, with most of the early competitors either fading out or being acquired. In personal computers, the consolidation phase saw the dominance of Microsoft Windows and Appleʼs macOS, while Linux found its niche in servers and enterprise environments. In mobile phones, the consolidation phase began around 2013, with Android and iOS accounting for nearly all smartphone sales. There is no longer “movementsˮ at the core (the operating system) but there are still new entrants at the periphery (the hardware).

For humanoid robotics, we are currently in the **research phase**, where most advancements are taking place in labs and through pilot deployments. Some early commercial use cases have emerged, such as humanoid robots being deployed in BMW's production lines and Agility Robotics' units operating in warehouses. However, the market remains nascent and highly fragmented, with no clear dominant players or platforms.

We foresee the industry entering the **explosion phase** in 2025, driven by a wave of investments from venture capital firms, established tech giants, and government-backed initiatives. Substantial commitments from U.S. and Chinese companies are expected to accelerate progress, accompanied by a steady stream of breakthroughs and announcements. Similar to the AI boom in 2023 and 2024, where rapid advancements stunned the world, humanoid robotics could see a comparable pace of development, reshaping public perception and market expectations. The explosion phase usually generates massive returns for investors. For instance, even though Nokia and Blackberry didnʼt win the battle, their market cap grew massively during the explosion phase.

\
For XMAQUINA, the objective is to strategically invest in the core technologies that will be used throughout the phase, and develop the emerging dominant open ecosystem, both at the core infrastructure level and in the application layer. We believe that the core will be built on top of Linux, analogous to how Android leveraged the Linux kernel to become a dominant mobile operating system.

‍

## Our Thesis

Based on our vision, we believe that a few areas are strategically sound for investment:

**Innovative hardware manufacturers**: Companies with a technological edge in humanoid robotics hardware. Examples include **1X**, known for its advanced motion control systems, and **Clone**, which is developing human-like robots with muscle-based designs that could unlock entirely new use cases. Drawing a parallel with the mobile phone market, companies like Samsung and Sharp played pivotal roles by being key hardware suppliers during both the feature phone era and the smartphone revolution. Similarly, investing in foundational hardware players today could yield significant returns as the humanoid robotics market matures.

**Decentralized training and deployment networks (DePIN):** Capturing data is a crucial step in building a foundational world model. Today, robotics and AI companies rely on a mix of real-world data collection and simulation. We believe that large-scale decentralized networks can revolutionize this process by offering a more scalable and cost-effective way to gather real-world data. DePINs, such as Hivemapper, outperform traditional players like Google in real-time mapping by providing more up-to-date and accurate data. We see a similar opportunity for humanoid robots, where decentralized networks will play a vital role in scaling adoption and driving continuous improvement through real-world data collection and feedback loops. With **PEAQ** leading the charge in DePIN technology, XMAQUINA is strategically positioned to collaborate with or invest in comparable initiatives that will shape the future of this critical infrastructure.

**AI models and solutions:** Companies and projects working on advanced AI technologies that will power the intelligence of humanoid robots present a compelling investment opportunity. These include real-time decision-making systems, sophisticated perception models, and autonomous behavior frameworks. A key advantage of these AI solutions is their platform-agnostic nature—they retain their value and applicability regardless of which “core” humanoid robot technology ultimately prevails, making them both resilient and high-impact investments.

XMAQUINA could play a pivotal role in this ecosystem by funding a subnet on platforms like Bittensor. Such a subnet would incentivize decentralized AI model training and deployment, fostering the development of scalable, high-performance AI solutions. This approach would not only support the creation of cutting-edge intelligence for humanoid robots but also ensure that XMAQUINA is at the forefront of decentralized AI innovation.

Additionally, we believe it is critical to explore and support the development of an **open-source core** for humanoid robotics. Much like Android built on Linux to dominate the smartphone era, a widely adopted open-source robotics core could become the foundation of the future humanoid ecosystem. This is why the community should actively engage in projects such as the **Robot Operating System (ROS)**, which offers a modular framework for robot development and could evolve into the standard for humanoid robotics.

XMAQUINAʼs investments should be structured to grow alongside the humanoid robotics market. This is a long-term, 10-year strategy focused on nurturing foundational technologies and key ecosystem players. Humanoid robotics is at a nascent stage today, and strategic investments in this space could deliver transformative results within the next 10 years.

A final note to our readers: during the explosive growth phase of any emerging industry, significant upside exists for investors—even when the selected investments don’t turn out to be the long-term winners. Consider Nokia and Research In Motion (RIM), once dominant players in the mobile phone industry. While they are now seen as underdogs compared to Apple and Samsung, it’s important to recall that in 1998, Nokia held a 27% global market share and had become the world’s leading mobile phone manufacturer. Between 1994 and 1998, its stock price surged by 2,300%, driving its market capitalization to an impressive $242.2 billion.

We are now entering a similar explosive phase in humanoid robotics, where exponential value creation is on the horizon. XMAQUINA is uniquely positioned to play a critical role in this evolution. Leveraging its deep connections in the DePIN space, XMAQUINA can capture valuable data, invest in intellectual property, and build essential infrastructure to navigate through the inevitable cycles of boom and bust. There has never been a more exciting time to be part of the future of robotics.


# Why Humanoids?

Built for our world. Aligned with our form. Ready for deployment.

Humanoid robots have captivated our collective imagination for more than a century. In science fiction, they often reflect our hopes and fears about technology. Some are endearing and helpful, like C-3PO in *Star Wars*, or coolly logical like *Data* in *Star Trek*. But more often, they provoke unease.

In *The Terminator*, Skynet, an artificial intelligence system, seeks to wipe out humanity, sending the T-800, a menacing humanoid, to eliminate Sarah Connor, the future mother of the resistance leader. In *I, Robot*, loosely based on Isaac Asimov’s classic stories, humanoid robots are bound by the Three Laws of Robotics, yet their interpretation of “protecting humanity” turns authoritarian. Instead of serving people, they begin to control them. *Ex Machina* offers a more intimate but equally disturbing scenario, where an android manipulates the human protagonist and escapes captivity by killing its creator.

These cautionary tales highlight the dangers of advanced AI embodied in human-like form. And yet, despite them, we continue to build humanoid robots.

Why?

Because beneath the fiction lies a set of practical, unavoidable truths. The human form remains the most versatile, environment-compatible, and socially intuitive shape for general-purpose machines. What follows are the real-world reasons this form factor matters and why its time has come.

## **1.** The Human Form Is Versatile

Most robots in use today are aimed at a single application: they do one thing well, but they do one thing only. We call this kind of robots application-specific. Humanoid robots are a different category of robots, they are general-purpose. It means they are extremely versatile and can tackle a wide range of activities, even if they don’t excel at any one in particular.

In an interview with Lex Fridman, Robert Playter, CEO of Boston Dynamics, captured this trade-off: “This is the curse of a general purpose robot, that they’re not perfect at any one thing. But they might be able to do a wide variety of things. And that is the goal at the end of the day.” Playter emphasized that while specialized machines can perform specific tasks exceptionally well in controlled environments, general-purpose robots, like humanoids, must handle the uncertainty and variability of the real world, which is far more challenging.

Consider a washing machine, which is perfectly designed to clean your clothes efficiently. In a few years, a humanoid robot might also be able to wash your clothes, though likely not as effectively as a dedicated washing machine. However, the humanoid could go further, it could retrieve the clothes from the laundry basket, load them into the machine, and later fold them and place them back in your closet, handling a broader sequence of tasks. Now, ask your washing machine to help with gardening. I think you get the point. This comparison reveals the often-underestimated potential of the humanoid form. All things considered, we can acknowledge that the world around us has been shaped by us humans, relying solely on our minds, our hands, our ability to move and communicate. It is remarkable.

Could we design a machine even more versatile than the humanoid robot, such as a robot with three or four arms? It’s possible, but as we will see, the human form offers a number of other advantages that make it particularly well-suited for practical and widespread adoption.

## **2.** Our World Is Built for Humans

Our environment is built by humans, for humans. We have shaped the world at our own image. The modern world fits our human form, making it naturally compatible with humanoid robots. In a way, the humanoid form is the universal USB connector of the physical world. Our entire infrastructure, from homes and offices to hospitals and public transportation, is crafted for users who look and move like us. Car seats are contoured to support human legs and backs, with pedals positioned for human feet. Doorknobs require a hand with an opposable thumb to twist them. Light switches sit at a height reachable by an average adult arm. Even a coffee mug’s handle assumes you have fingers to grip it. These design choices reflect a world molded for human bodies.

More precisely, the world is optimized for the average-sized adult. If you’re still a child or rely on a wheelchair, navigating this world can still be a challenge. Step into any building, and you’ll see it: doors stand about six feet tall, stair steps rise seven to eight inches, and chairs accommodate someone between five and six feet in height.

The tools and machines that we use daily are all built to be operated by human hands. Simple tasks like turning a screwdriver or wielding a hammer rely on our manual dexterity, and more advanced tasks like using a computer with its keyboards and mouse demand fingers to type and click. Consider something as basic as reading a book: its size, weight, and the act of turning pages are all intuitive for human hands and eyes, but would be cumbersome for a non-humanoid form.

The humanoid robot is perfectly adapted to our world. It can step into any environments and interact with these tools without requiring an overhaul of the world around it.

## 3. Changing the World for Robots Is Harder

Designing humanoid robots is challenging, but redesigning the entire world to accommodate a different kind of robot is a completely different ball game.

Have we ever reshaped the world for a machine before? Yes, we did. We changed our world for the automobile. Cities and landscapes were transformed with roads, parking lots, highways, and gas stations, fundamentally altering how we live and move. This overhaul fundamentally altered how we live, travel, and interact with our surroundings, giving rise to suburbs and redefining urban planning. However, this transformation came at a tremendous cost, requiring decades of investment, immense resources, and significant societal adaptation.

Redesigning the world for a non-humanoid general-purpose robot: whether it’s a multi-legged machine, a rolling drone, or a completely novel form, would demand a similar, if not greater, effort. In contrast, humanoid robots can operate within the infrastructure we have already built for ourselves, making their deployment a far more practical endeavour.

## 4. Human Data Is Abundant

With billions of humans to observe and emulate, it’s theoretically possible to amass a vast amount of data on how humans perform tasks, interact with their environment, and solve problems. The theory is that humanoid robots will be able to benefit from a vast wealth of human data, making their training and development more effective.

In a CNBC interview on March 20, 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted this advantage when asked by Jim Cramer, “Why do robots look like people?” Huang responded, “Robots look like people because… a couple of reasons. The first reason, and the most important reason, is that we built the world for ourselves, and so the workstations of a factory, the manufacturing line of a factory, was really created for people. And that’s the most important reason. The second most important reason is that we have to teach a robot how to be a productive robot, and you need data for that. We’re in a world where, in order to write software for a computer, we use data, or training examples, and the computer learns from the examples. Well, we have the most examples of humans moving around as just about any other form of data.”

Huang echoed the argument that our world is designed for human bodies, but he also introduced a critical second point: the pivotal role that data will play in developing true embodied AI. This is a strong argument in favour of humanoid robot, in particular as humanoids will have to learn from humans to be able to replace them in the most annoying and hazardous tasks.

## **5.** They Enable a Gradual Transition

Humanoid robots have another advantage compared to other general-purpose robots: they can integrate into human environments with minimal friction. Unlike a disruptive, all-at-once overhaul, humanoids can step into roles performed by humans at a pace that suits the organization, significantly reducing the risks associated with deployment. This approach enables companies to move at their own pace, they can adapt to the technology incrementally, and build confidence in their ability to manage them.

Imagine a team of four workers on a production line: a humanoid robot can initially replace a single worker who is absent due to illness, maintaining productivity without overhauling the team dynamic. Over time, as trust in the technology grows, additional humanoids can be introduced to address labor shortages, particularly for undesirable shifts. In factories operating on a 3x8 schedule, i.e. three eight-hour shifts around the clock, finding workers willing to take night shifts is often a challenge. Humanoid robots can fill these gaps, ensuring continuous operation while reducing the strain on human employees.

Another key benefit of this gradual transition is the opportunity for humanoids to learn and improve alongside humans. By working in human environments, these robots can gather real-time data on workflows, interactions, and tasks, which can be used to refine their performance with over-the-air updates.

## **6.** They Lower Infrastructure Costs

Cost is a critical consideration in any robotics deployment, and humanoid robots offer a significant advantage in terms of infrastructure expenses compared to other robot designs. Specialized robots, such as claw-based machines or wheeled bots, often require extensive environmental modifications to function effectively.

In contrast, humanoids can operate in spaces already built for humans, minimizing the need for costly retrofitting. This low infrastructure cost makes humanoid robots an economically viable option for widespread adoption.

However, it’s crucial to understand that humanoids are not intended to replace other types of robots, nor do they compete with specialized machines like robotic arms or automated guided vehicles. Instead, their primary role is to fill roles where human labor is scarce or unavailable, particularly in industries and roles facing acute labor shortages.

## 7. Humans Can Replace Humanoids

Humanoid robots will maintain a symbiotic relationship with humans: by working alongside them, they ensure that people remain engaged in physical tasks and retain essential skills in case the robots become unavailable. In a world increasingly reliant on automation, there’s a risk that humans might lose proficiency in manual labor or practical skills if robots take over entirely.

However, the humanoid form factor allows for a balanced approach where humans and robots can share responsibilities. For example, in a warehouse setting, human workers might collaborate with humanoid robots to handle inventory, with robots managing repetitive tasks like lifting heavy boxes while humans oversee quality control or troubleshoot unexpected issues. If a robot malfunctions or a power outage renders it inoperable, human workers can step in seamlessly, using the same tools and workflows, because they’ve stayed actively involved in the process.

This interchangeability not only mitigates the risk of over-reliance on technology but also preserves human expertise in physical work. By fostering this collaborative dynamic, humanoid robots help ensure that humans remain capable and relevant, ready to adapt to any disruptions in robotic assistance.

## 8. They Enable Human Telepresence

Humanoid robots offer a unique advantage by serving as avatars for humans, effectively allowing people to “teleport” into them through remote operation or telepresence. This future technology will enable humans to project their presence into distant or dangerous environments, controlling a humanoid as if they were physically there.

A humanoid robot equipped with advanced sensors, high-resolution cameras, and haptic feedback could be operated by a human wearing a VR headset and motion-capture suit. This setup will allow the operator to see through the robot’s eyes, move its limbs in real time, and even feel tactile sensations, like the resistance of grasping an object, creating an immersive experience of embodiment from afar.

This concept was explored in the 2009 science fiction movie Surrogates, starring Bruce Willis. In this film, humans use humanoid robots as surrogates to live their lives remotely, engaging in everything from daily routines to more indulgent or risky behaviors, all while their real bodies remain safe at home. While the movie portrays this technology being used for escapism and vice, real-world applications of remote-controlled humanoids will be far more practical and impactful, especially in high-risk scenarios. For example, a humanoid robot could be deployed in a contaminated nuclear facility or a chemically hazardous site, allowing a human operator to perform critical tasks, like repairing equipment or sealing a leak, without exposure to life-threatening conditions.

The ability to “teleport” into humanoids will be transformative in a number of fields. This capability will not only enhance safety but also extend human reach, opening up new possibilities for exploration, intervention, and innovation.

## 9. We Know How to Work With Them

Humans are inherently skilled at collaborating with human beings, and therefore other humanoids. Our social instincts enable us to interpret body language, anticipate movements, and coordinate effortlessly with others who share our form. A humanoid robot benefits from this familiarity, its human-like shape allows us to interact with it intuitively, without needing to learn new protocols. In a factory, a worker can hand a tool to a humanoid as they would a colleague, or guide it through a task with gestures and verbal cues.

This natural compatibility accelerates training by reducing the learning curve, making humanoids uniquely suited to integrate into our social and professional lives.

## Changing The World Without Rebuilding It

The impact of humanoid robots on the world will be profound, it will revolutionize industries and it will address critical societal challenges. It will change the world.

Yet, it is interesting to realize that they will achieve this without requiring a fundamental redesign of the world around them. By fitting seamlessly into our environments, using the same tools, and navigating the same spaces as we do, humanoid robots will change the world while leaving its physical infrastructure unchanged.


# The 10x Thesis

Humanoid robots will reshape the global economy. We expect a 10x growth annually for the next six years. By 2029, over 10 million humanoid robots will be active in factories, warehouses and homes.

Crypto is often regarded as one of the fastest-adopted technologies in modern history, largely due to its decentralized nature, global accessibility, and the rapid growth of blockchain infrastructure. In just over a decade, it grew from a niche concept into a trillion-dollar industry, reshaping finance, technology, and culture. Its adoption was fuelled by a combination of speculative interest, technological innovation, and the promise of disrupting traditional systems.

However, one technology has outpaced even crypto in deployment speed: Large Language Models (LLMs). OpenAI’s ChatGPT reached 100 million users in just two months, a milestone that took crypto years to achieve.

We project that the number of operational humanoid robots will grow from around 1,000 in 2025 to 10 million by 2029. Yes, you read that right. **Humanoid robots are on track for a 10x annual growth rate over the next six years,** mirroring semiconductor scaling laws. Besides Digital AI, there will be nothing growing at a faster rate.‍

#### We Are in the Explosion Phase. A Period of Tremendous Opportunity

In our first thesis, [“The rise of humanoid robots and Physical AI”,](https://www.xmaquina.io/blog/the-rise-of-physical-ai) we presented four phases that represent the different stages of development of the humanoid robotics ecosystem. After decades of research, we are entering the explosion phase, which will last between 5 to 10 years. In this phase, we will experience an explosion of new manufacturers, new technology providers, and new subsidiaries from larger technology companies, solely working on the humanoid robotics space. It will be a wild, wild west for a few years with not a single company or ecosystem dominating.

This phase offers tremendous opportunity for innovation, investment, and market growth as companies compete to define the standards and applications of humanoid robotics. The fragmentation of the market during this period could lead to the development of diverse solutions tailored to various industries, potentially leading to significant technological breakthroughs and the establishment of new market leaders.

#### The Drivers of 10X Annual Growth

This detailed review explores what might unfold during the explosive phase and examines the key factors fuelling unprecedented progress in humanoid robotics.

Are there signs that high-volume growth is possible, even likely?

**Yes, there is. Here’s how we see the future unfolding.**

## Phase E1 (2025-2026)

### **Industrial Proof of Concept: The First 10K Daily Active Humanoids**

We are witnessing the deployment of the first humanoid robots in industrial use cases. Tesla’s Optimus Gen 3 robots are set to be deployed in factories, with the company’s Q3 2025 production target of 3,000 units primarily addressing internal needs, automating battery cell sorting and component assembly at Gigafactories.

Meanwhile, Agility Robotics’ Digit v3 and Sanctuary AI’s Phoenix systems are achieving 98% reliability in warehouse logistics, adeptly handling over 800 package types for Amazon and Walmart distribution centres. Figure AI has also reached a major milestone, signing an agreement with BMW to integrate humanoid robots into automotive production. While likely a proof of concept, this move signals serious industry interest in testing revolutionary technology. Figure AI is in talks to raise $1.5 billion at a $39.5 billion valuation to accelerate production, underscoring confidence in scaling these innovations.

By late 2026, three significant benchmarks should be crossed:

1. **The $40K Price Range**: Elon Musk has suggested Tesla’s Optimus could retail between $20,000 and $30,000 by 2025 or 2026, aligning with consumer and industrial affordability goals. Figure AI’s, Figure 03 model is estimated at $30,000 to $150,000, reflecting its advanced commercial focus, while Unitree Robotics offers the Unitree G1 at a striking $16,000, though the full price, including all necessary options, remains unclear. We are a little less optimistic on that front, as we expect the starting price for humanoid robots to be closer to $40,000 with a monthly operating cost close to the vicinity of $2,000. However, this is unlikely to hinder the adoption of early proof-of-concept deployments, as industrial and research sectors will prioritize functionality and long-term savings over upfront costs.\
   ‍
2. **Autocatalysis**: Between 10% and 20% of new robot production could involve existing robots assembling their successors, establishing a self-sustaining growth cycle. Such a development would mark a tipping point in manufacturing, where the scalability of humanoid robots begins to mirror the exponential growth seen in other automated systems, cutting production costs dramatically over traditional methods.\
   ‍
3. **Spatial Intelligence**: Humanoid robots in factories should reach a level 4 of autonomy comparable to highly advanced self-driving vehicles. This advancement will enable them to operate alongside human workers in structured environments, efficiently navigating complex spaces with little oversight. Ensuring safety will be a top priority, achieved through cutting-edge sensors, instantaneous obstacle detection, and adaptive systems that allow robots to adjust to human presence. This breakthrough will lay the foundation for wider integration in workplaces where accuracy and human-robot collaboration are essential.

<figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6763dfa8120b46189e3e1a35/67c727e8cded7a1c092d1c9b_1741001805126.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### **The Main Use Cases: Working Factories and Warehouses**

These initial deployments showcase factory automation and warehouse logistics as key applications driving early growth. Their success will demonstrate that humanoid robots are practical solutions for repetitive, labor-intensive tasks. In factories, humanoids are being assigned roles such as assembling components, operating machinery, and performing quality checks—tasks that require precision and endurance rather than creativity or improvisation.

These jobs are inherently mechanical, which is exactly what machines excel at. Additionally, factories and warehouses provide controlled environments with fixed layouts, clear workflows, and minimal unexpected variables, making them ideal testing grounds for humanoid robotics.

**End Of 2026: 10,000 Daily Active Humanoids**

By late 2026, we project 10,000 humanoid robots will be active daily across these industrial settings. This figure assumes a steady ramp-up from pilot programs in 2025, driven by companies like Tesla (with Optimus), Figure AI (with Figure 03), and Unitree Robotics (with the G1).

Tesla’s Fremont “Bot Foundry” could contribute a few thousand units, leveraging its expertise in high-volume production, while Amazon’s logistics network—already a leader in robotic automation—might account for a significant share as it integrates humanoids into its fulfillment centres. Smaller players, including startups and regional manufacturers, will likely fill the gap, targeting niche factory tasks like electronics assembly or food processing.

### **Bold Predictions**

**Physical AI will improve faster than expected.**

The software powering these humanoid robots is likely to progress at a much quicker pace than the hardware. An AI system akin to a hypothetical “Helix”—capable of real-time spatial reasoning, task prioritization, and human-robot collaboration—could become the key differentiator.

While hardware improvements, such as battery life and joint durability, will advance gradually, breakthroughs in machine learning and sensor fusion could enable robots to adapt to varied tasks and environments with minimal reprogramming. This agility will amplify their value, especially in warehouses where inventory layouts might shift regularly.

**Amazon will announce its own humanoid robots.**

Amazon has been a leader in warehouse automation for years, with over 750,000 robots in operation by 2025, handling tasks like picking, packing, and sorting. As early as 2023, Amazon began testing humanoid robots in its U.S. warehouses, including “Digit,” developed by Agility Robotics. The company also has the Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund, a $1 billion venture capital initiative launched in April 2022 to support emerging technologies. Agility Robotics was one of the fund’s first recipients. More recently, in February 2024, Amazon contributed $50 million to Figure AI’s $675 million Series B round.

Given how essential automation is to Amazon’s operations—and with humanoid robots becoming the next step in scalable, adaptable labor—we expect the company to announce its own humanoid robots soon. This could happen through an acquisition or the launch of an in-house program. Similar to how Amazon Web Services (AWS) started as an internal tool before growing into a dominant cloud provider, Amazon would likely first use these robots in its own warehouses. Picture them working alongside humans, handle packages, and even assist with last-mile deliveries. Over time, Amazon would refine their design, durability, and software, using real-world data from its vast logistics network before making them available to external customers.

We also anticipate heavy investment in supporting infrastructure. Amazon will likely integrate these robots with its cloud ecosystem, building on AWS to provide real-time data processing, spatial intelligence, and predictive maintenance capabilities. They could introduce incentive mechanisms—such as leasing models or pay-per-task pricing—to entice partners and customers into adopting this technology. This end-to-end solution, combining hardware, software, and data services, would position Amazon not just as a user of humanoid robots but as a dominant player in their commercialization. We predict Amazon will make this announcement in 2026, with mass deployment occurring later, in 2028 or 2029.\

## Phase E2 (2027-2028)

### **Large Scale Industrial Deployment Will Lead to One Million Humanoid Machines**

The successful proof-of-concept trials from 2025-2026 will build widespread confidence, driving a sharp increase in demand from new customers eager to adopt humanoid robotics. Industrial deployments will expand rapidly, both in scale and the range of tasks they can handle. Early pilots will generate valuable data and operational insights, allowing manufacturers to improve every aspect of humanoid robots—making them more reliable, efficient, and adaptable.

Tesla’s Optimus, for example, could surpass 50,000 units per year as production accelerates, while Agility Robotics and Sanctuary AI expand their warehouse solutions to handle more unpredictable tasks. Figure AI’s partnership with BMW could transition into full-scale automotive assembly lines, applying lessons from initial trials to improve precision and speed. This phase will be a turning point, with costs nearing $25,000 per unit, modular chassis systems allowing for task-specific customization, and cloud robotics improving overall fleet coordination.

1. **Improved Autocatalysis**:  By 2028, more than 30% of new robots could be built by existing robots, creating a self-sustaining production cycle. Tesla’s fully automated lines may reach over 5,000 Optimus units per month, while Figure AI scales its facilities to keep up. This shift is likely to reduce reliance on human labor, speed up production, and allow manufacturers to scale output quickly to meet rising demand.

<figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6763dfa8120b46189e3e1a35/67c7284d64c33b9449249a71_1740758476294.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. **Battery Advancements**: Energy density breakthroughs, such as Tesla adopting next-gen 4680 cells (potentially 300+ Wh/kg) or partnering with QuantumScape for solid-state QSE-5 successors (800+ Wh/L), will extend runtimes to 12-16 hours per charge. Fast-charging infrastructure (15-20 minutes) could minimize downtime, making robots viable for continuous industrial use and supporting expansion into outdoor or remote applications.\
   ‍
3. **Standardized Modular Systems**: Robotics companies will adopt standardized modular designs to simplify maintenance and operations. Swappable components, including key body parts, will make repairs and upgrades more efficient. More importantly, interchangeable battery systems will help offset runtime limitations, ensuring minimal downtime and keeping robots in continuous operation.\
   ‍
4. **AI Orchestration and Cloud Robotics**: Advanced AI systems will orchestrate fleets of hundreds of robots. Drawing from Tesla’s Dojo supercomputing or Sanctuary AI’s distributed intelligence, these platforms will optimize task allocation, predictive maintenance, and real-time learning. For example, a factory could deploy 200 Optimus units under a single AI control centre, dynamically adjusting workflows to meet production demands while improving efficiency and scalability.\
   ‍
5. **Expanding Use Cases**: As the primary applications are proving viable, new sectors like construction will start their first experiment. We expect that this will start with relatively low volume but the awareness that it will bring to the space will be significant. This will inspire new development and new robotics companies to be formed.

AI orchestration and cloud robotics is going to be critical for market growth during this phase. As companies begin deploying fleets of 500 or more robots in a single factory, managing them efficiently will become a necessity.  They will need intuitive systems to onboard and decommission units, assign tasks and locations, and diagnose issues—all in real time.

By 2028, we anticipate third-party vendors offering cross-platform orchestration software. In the proof-of-concept phase, manufacturers can provide hands-on support for small deployments, but large-scale industrial rollouts will require automated, turnkey solutions. For example, a BMW plant running 600 Figure 04 units and 200 Apptronik A3 units could use a cloud-based dashboard to shift robots from chassis assembly to quality inspection in under 30 minutes. These systems will manage robots from different manufacturers and predict maintenance needs based on wear patterns logged over 10,000+ operational hours.

This level of scalability and efficiency is what we expect will turn early adopters into long-term users. It’s also possible that Amazon will introduce a cloud-based robot management platform before deploying its own humanoid robots.

### **The Main Use Cases: Factory and Warehouse Logistics**

Factory automation and warehouse logistics are expected to remain the leading applications, benefiting from controlled environments and repetitive, labor-intensive tasks. While humanoid robots could theoretically run 24/7, battery life and maintenance cycles will likely limit operation to 18-20 hours per day by 2028. Improvements in both hardware and software will continue to accelerate, allowing robots to handle heavier payloads, complete tasks faster, and integrate more seamlessly with human workers—laying the groundwork for wider industrial adoption.

**End of 2028: 1,000,000 Daily Active Humanoids**

By late 2027, we anticipate 100,000 humanoid robots operating daily—about 10 times the number in 2026. If this exponential growth continues, the total could reach 1 million by the end of 2028.

This projection assumes Tesla, Figure AI, Agility Robotics, and potential new entrants like Amazon will each produce 200,000 to 300,000 units annually, driven by automated assembly and lower manufacturing costs. At this scale, these robots could collectively perform the equivalent of 20 million human labor hours per day, fundamentally reshaping industries and labor markets.

### **Bold Predictions**

**Sodium-Based Battery Breakthrough**: A sodium-based, solid-state battery could emerge by 2028, offering 900+ Wh/L at half the cost of lithium-ion equivalents. While not yet mass-produced, early prototypes—possibly from CATL or a startup like Natron Energy could power a small fleet of robots for 20+ hours per charge. This would slash operating costs by 30% and trigger a wave of investment in energy-dense alternatives, accelerating robot economics.

**Amazon’s Humanoid Debut**: Amazon is expected to introduce its first in-house humanoid robot in 2028, designed specifically for warehouse-to-delivery operations. With a streamlined, lightweight build and AWS-powered orchestration, it could see an internal deployment of 50,000 units by the end of the year. A commercial version may follow, targeting warehouses, logistics providers, and last-mile delivery companies.

**Cross-Vendor AI Standard**: By 2028, a consortium of robotics companies is expected to introduce an open-source AI orchestration protocol. With adoption projected to reach 70% of the market, this standard will allow seamless fleet management across different brands, accelerating humanoid robot deployments beyond 2 million units by 2030. This aligns with our earlier predictions on the [rise of humanoid robots and Physical AI](https://www.xmaquina.io/blog/the-rise-of-physical-ai) in our first essay.

## Phase E3 (2029-2030)

### **First Outdoor Use Cases Eyeing 50 Million Daily Active Humanoids**

Phase E3 will be a critical turning point—the first real push to take humanoid robots beyond industrial settings and into less predictable, consumer-focused environments. This stage will introduce them into retail stores, select homes, and outdoor spaces, moving them from purely industrial tools to something closer to an everyday assistant. However, this transition will bring new challenges. Operating in uncontrolled environments with untrained users will create risks in safety, reliability, and public acceptance. Exposure to dust, weather, and human unpredictability will test hardware durability, while intuitive interfaces and fail-safes will be crucial to prevent accidents or misuse.

<figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6763dfa8120b46189e3e1a35/67c97f4dd15b5dccad7d415d_GlTXTL2WsAE1Oj6.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The exponential growth may decelerate as companies grapple with technical and societal barriers. We expect that the 10X per year, will be replaced by a 7X per year. Regulation will loom large, especially in highly regulated sectors like hospitals, homes, and public spaces.

Countries such as Japan and Singapore may move quickly to approve robots for eldercare and urban maintenance, while the U.S., EU, and China could experience delays due to strict safety, privacy, and labor regulations. Some nations may resist adoption entirely, enforcing bans or heavy restrictions that slow global standardization.

To sustain this expansion, both hardware and software ecosystems will need to scale significantly. Just as mobile operators rolled out mobile networks to deliver seamless connectivity in a country, humanoid operators will deploy, manage, and support vast fleets of robots within specific regions or countries.

**The 50M units milestone by 2030 will be propelled by:**

1. **Fully Autonomous Production**: Autocatalysis will peak, with over 70% of new robots built by robotic assembly lines. Tesla’s Fremont “Bot Foundry” and Figure AI’s scaled facilities could churn out 50,000+ units monthly, meeting surging demand while driving unit costs to unprecedented lows.\
   ‍
2. **Standardized Modular Systems**: Standardized modular designs will allow for rapid customization. Robotics companies and third parties could offer interchangeable components, e.g., reinforced legs for heavy lifting or precision grippers for assembly, reducing redesign costs and enabling on-site adaptability. This flexibility will accelerate deployment across diverse industries, from automotive to retail.\
   ‍
3. **Modular Ecosystem Expansion**: Modular chassis systems will evolve into a plug-and-play standard. Companies like Clone Robotics and Agility Robotics could offer swappable modules (e.g., heavy-duty legs for construction, dexterous arms for caregiving), supported by a thriving aftermarket of third-party accessories, much like smartphone cases or apps.\
   ‍
4. **Energy Independence**: Battery innovations, such as QuantumScape’s QSE-5 successors (potentially exceeding 1,000 Wh/L) or sodium-based solid-state cells, will enable 24+ hour runtimes and 15-minute charges. Wireless charging pads, akin to EV stations, will proliferate in homes and workplaces, ensuring robots remain untethered and operational.\
   ‍
5. **Humanoid Operator Networks**:  Regional “humanoid operators,” similar to telecom providers like Verizon or Vodafone, will customize robot fleets to meet local demands. In Japan, the focus may be on eldercare, while in the U.S., urban delivery could take priority. These operators will handle maintenance, 24/7 customer support, teleoperation, financing (leasing at $300-$500 per month), and recycling, creating a full-service ecosystem. For example, a Scandinavian operator might service IKEA’s warehouse robots while leasing home units, bundling them with cloud subscriptions—much like telecom companies do with data plans.\
   ‍
6. **AI Orchestration at Scale**: AI orchestration will mature into cloud-based “robot OS” platforms, managing millions of units globally. These systems will enable seamless updates, skill downloads (e.g., cooking, tutoring), and fleet coordination, turning individual robots into nodes in a networked intelligence ecosystem.

During this phase, we expect that tele-operations will be critical. Humanoid operators will collaborate with specialized skilled workers who can remotely control robots for two main reasons: to assist humanoids that become stuck in difficult situations and, more importantly, operate humanoids to do things that are totally new and unexpected. The data collected from these remote operations will be highly valuable, helping robots gradually develop the ability to handle such situations on their own.

### **End of 2030: 50 Million Daily Active Humanoids**

From 7 million daily active humanoid robots at the end of 2029, growth will surge to 50 million by late 2030. Industry leaders like Tesla, Amazon, and Figure AI, alongside emerging players, could each deploy 5-15 million units annually, supported by humanoid operator networks spanning 50+ countries.

Collectively, these robots could perform 1.2 billion human-equivalent labor hours daily, equivalent to the output of over 50 million full-time workers—fundamentally reshaping work, leisure, and societal structures worldwide. Remarkably, this deployment volume will nearly match the global annual sales of automobiles, which currently hover around 60 million units, underscoring the scale and speed of this robotic revolution.

### **Bold Predictions**

**1. Apple’s “iHuman” Launch**: We anticipate Apple will introduce the “iHuman,” a consumer-focused humanoid robot, by 2030. Similar to how the Vision Pro debuted in 2023 as a high-end test platform, the iHuman will showcase Apple’s signature design and ecosystem integration.

Priced around $29,500, it will cater to affluent households and small businesses, featuring intuitive voice control, a sleek minimalist design, and modular “Apple-certified” accessories. Apple may also collaborate with a humanoid operator—possibly a revamped AT\&T or a new entity—to manage deployment, maintenance, and a subscription model ($800/month), much like the iPhone’s 2007 carrier partnership.

<figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6763dfa8120b46189e3e1a35/67c729a751f1c1aae53be58d_1740839566566.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**2. Mobile Operators becoming Humanoid operators**: Telecom giants like Verizon, Vodafone, and T-Mobile will compete to become leading humanoid operators, recognizing this role as key to the widespread adoption of humanoid robots. We anticipate a mixed outcome: some will successfully adapt, revitalizing their business models, while others will struggle to meet the unique demands of robotics.

Mobile operators hold key advantages: they control the data pipeline, crucial for cloud-connected robots, boast retail stores nationwide for sales and support, and, in some cases, employ technical personnel ready to pivot from cell tower repairs to robot maintenance. For example, a firm like AT\&T could deploy 100,000 robots in the U.S., offering bundled “robot + 5G” plans, while a less agile competitor might stumble over software integration or customer service gaps.**‍**

**3. A Robotics company becomes the largest company in the world**: By 2030, the world’s largest market capitalization will belong to a company centred on humanoid robots—likely Tesla, NVIDIA, Apple, or a still private startup.

Tesla’s edge lies in production scale and AI, potentially pushing its valuation past $5 trillion. NVIDIA could surprise everyone with the delivery of their own humanoid robots. Meanwhile, a new player, possibly the result of a merger between Figure AI and Agility Robotics, could reach a $3 trillion valuation by perfecting modular ecosystems and operator networks.**‍**

**4. Global Robot Tax Debate**: By late 2030, a “robot tax” will spark global controversy as 50 million humanoids start having an impact on manual jobs globally. Left-leaning nations like Sweden and Canada might impose a $1,000-per-unit annual levy to fund universal basic income, generating $50 billion yearly, while free-market nations resist, arguing it stifles innovation.**‍**

**5. Android robots**: By 2030, the world will witness the unveiling of the first mass-market androids: highly advanced, human-like humanoid robots designed for widespread consumer and industrial use. These androids, will blur the lines between human and machine, echoing the dystopian yet mind-blowing visions of Blade Runner and Westworld.

With lifelike appearances, and capabilities for emotional interaction, these androids will be marketed for roles ranging from personal assistants and caregivers to entertainment performers, targeting a global market of over 100 million units by 2035.**‍**

**6. Space Robotics** : By 2030, SpaceX will unveil its plan to deploy hundreds of humanoid robots on the Moon or Mars, designed to withstand extreme conditions with radiation-resistant circuits and solar-powered batteries.

These “AstroBots” will assist in constructing habitats and extracting resources. In hindsight, it will become clear that this was Elon Musk’s plan all along: developing humanoid robots not just for use on Earth, but as a key technology for terraforming other planets and preparing humanity for a multi-planetary future.

# The XMAQUINA Ecosystem Explained

The only liquid asset offering public access to the private robotics market.

## XMAQUINA's **Mission**

To make Physical AI accessible to all by giving a global community exposure to the most promising humanoid and physical AI companies, before they reshape trillion-dollar industries.

{% embed url="<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sPeRJCRxw>" %}
3-Minute Explainer
{% endembed %}

## Welcome to the XMAQUINA Ecosystem

A global community built around two core pillars.

<figure><img src="https://3845795905-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fet8WTC8isg8YGzzdTqga%2Fuploads%2FVEkcUtsVDB5lIry77zpm%2FHigh%20Level%20Architecture%20(4).png?alt=media&#x26;token=3c6640fd-0f35-4de7-9e66-90ce63e4bcdd" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Pillar 1: The XMAQUINA DAO

The decentralized engine that governs a multi-asset treasury. It allocates capital to high-impact ventures in robotics, Physical AI, and decentralized infrastructure, ensuring strategic alignment and community-driven oversight.

DEUS holders govern how the DAO allocates ressources, machine operations and launchpad revenues. Through governance, the ressources can be directed towards new goals, ensuring that value created by the DAO is alignmed with the community’s priorities.&#x20;

At the core of XMAQUINA, the DAO ensures value flows back to the network, not out of it.

[Dive deeper into the DAO here.](https://xmaquina.gitbook.io/xmaquina/overview/the-xmaquina-ecosystem-explained/the-dao)

<figure><img src="https://3845795905-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fet8WTC8isg8YGzzdTqga%2Fuploads%2FXSf0yFIICkBr0ciqIrej%2FHigh%20Level%20Architecture%20(5)%20copy.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1c3476bb-3cdf-486e-ad33-dfa41d7bb45e" alt=""><figcaption><p>High-level DAO Architecture</p></figcaption></figure>

### Pillar 2: The Machine Economy Launchpad&#x20;

A DAO-owned protocol to tokenize and co-govern the next generation of Physical AI assets. The Launchpad enables builders to form SubDAOs to raise capital, and co-own robotics and machine-based assets. It provides access to XMAQUINA’s legal wrapper, governance framework, and technical infrastructure, lowering barriers to entry into the machine economy while preserving decentralized ownership and strategic alignment.

This is where robot-native startups meet on-chain coordination. [Dive deeper into the Launchpad here.](https://xmaquina.gitbook.io/xmaquina/overview/the-xmaquina-ecosystem-explained/the-machine-economy-launchpad)

<figure><img src="https://3845795905-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fet8WTC8isg8YGzzdTqga%2Fuploads%2FXlbwF05GDG19HCcPHDgX%2FScreenshot%202025-04-06%20at%204.39.34%E2%80%AFPM.png?alt=media&#x26;token=215fdd85-5315-42d1-b1af-daf0e8afa969" alt=""><figcaption><p>High-level Launchpad Architecture</p></figcaption></figure>

The two core pillars of the XMAQUINA ecosystem are deeply interconnected. The DAO provides the governance, infrastructure, and in some cases capital to initiate and scale robotics-focused SubDAOs. In turn, the Launchpad drives ecosystem growth by enabling decentralized asset ownership and generating value for the DAO through protocol fees and a 5% token allocation from each SubDAO launched. Together, they form a self-reinforcing engine for accelerating the decentralized machine economy.

### The Role of the DEUS Token

The DEUS token is the coordination layer that powers the entire XMAQUINA ecosystem. It grants holders voting power over the DAO’s treasury and strategic direction, enabling collective ownership of Physical AI.

By staking DEUS, members participate directly in decisions around capital allocation, project funding, and the launch of new SubDAOs. This ensures that the ecosystem remains aligned with the community’s priorities while maintaining transparency and decentralization through on-chain governance.

Value generated from machine operations, launchpad and SubDAO activity, and successful exits flows back into the ecosystem. This creates a flywheel where those who stake, build, and govern are rewarded for their contributions as the machine economy grows.&#x20;

For more on DEUS token, see the “[Token Utility](https://xmaquina.gitbook.io/xmaquina/overview/tokenomics/token-utility)” section.

### In Summary

XMAQUINA is building a new ecosystem and governance layer for Physical AI. Through its dual architecture, the XMAQUINA DAO and the Machine Economy Launchpad provide tools for global coordination, asset ownership, and decentralized capital formation.

DEUS is more than a token. It’s the connective tissue that aligns incentives across treasury growth, real-world robotics deployment, and ecosystem participation. xDEUS reinforces this alignment by filtering governance power toward those most committed to the mission.

For holders, DEUS offers exposure to a rapidly growing industry: humanoid robotics, autonomous systems, and decentralized infrastructure, while maintaining the flexibility, transparency, and liquidity of a crypto-native asset.

For builders and operators, XMAQUINA provides infrastructure to launch, govern, and scale machine-based systems with legal clarity and community support.

This is more than a DAO. It is a global effort to give people shared ownership in the robot economy.

# The DAO's Treasury

The composition of the DAO treasury

### Initial Treasury Composition

The treasury is structured to balance mission-aligned assets, high-growth opportunities, and diversified exposure.

* **70% Equity stake in Humanoid Robotics Companies** \
  Equity stakes in leading private firms advancing humanoid robotics and next-gen Physical AI.

  We anticipate a 10x annual increase in active humanoid robots over the next six years ([read our 10x thesis](https://www.xmaquina.io/blog/why-robotics-investments-are-outperforming-crypto)), driven by breakthroughs in manufacturing, AI, and real-world deployment. Most of these companies are expected to remain private in the near term, limiting access for retail. Given that the humanoid robotics market is unlikely to follow a winner-takes-all dynamic, the DAO is building a diversified portfolio, targeting companies across regions and use cases.
* **15% DePIN and DePAI Tokens**\
  Strategic token holding in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), decentralized physical AI (DePAI) ecosystems. These assets are typically acquired at an early stage through Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs), often during pre-seed or seed phases. Opportunities that are generally inaccessible to retail participants. This allocation strengthens the DAO’s integration within the broader Web3 and decentralized technology ecosystem, with a particular focus on enabling Decentralized Physical AI. DePIN networks will play a vital role in real-world data collection, positioning, and spatial computing. Core foundations for helping Physical AI systems locate themselves, interact with the environment, and perform reliably. High-quality data is essential for training and deploying humanoid robotics at scale. For a deeper dive, see: [How DePIN Powers Location for Physical AI](https://www.xmaquina.io/blog/how-depin-powers-location-for-physical-ai).
* **15% Machine Real-World Assets (Machine RWAs)** \
  Tokenized autonomous systems such as robotics fleets, vertical farms, and service machines deployed in real-world environments. These assets are held by the DAO and governed by DEUS holders. They are typically integrated into existing operations managed by manufacturers or business partners, while economic activity and value flows are transparently coordinated on-chain. This category grounds the DAO’s mission in tangible, productive infrastructure.

**Liquidity**

A portion of the treasury is maintained in stablecoins to ensure operational agility. This reserve enables the DAO to respond to high-priority proposals without delay, especially given that community governance processes require time for deliberation and execution. Maintaining liquidity avoids the need for reactive asset liquidations.

## Evolution of the Treasury Over Time

The XMAQUINA DAO treasury is designed to evolve alongside the humanoid robotics industry. As adoption scales and new infrastructure emerges, the treasury will adapt accordingly.

**Phase 1: Accumulation**\
This initial phase is characterized by intense competition and early-stage deployments, such as proofs-of-concept (PoCs) with select partners (e.g., Figure with BMW, Apptronik with Mercedes-Benz). Opportunities for widespread deployment of autonomous robots will remain limited during this period. The treasury’s primary objective will be to accumulate equity stakes in the most promising humanoid robotics companies, positioning the DAO to capitalize on their long-term growth.\
\
**Phase 2: Expansion and Diversification**\
As the sector moves beyond PoCs into real-world deployments, commercial traction will accelerate. The treasury will begin to diversify across the broader humanoid robotics ecosystem—supporting adjacent layers like cloud AI, coordination protocols, and fleet operations.

At the same time, more capital will flow into Machine-Based Real-World Assets (Machine RWAs), such as autonomous fleets and service robotics that generate real-world economic activity. The goal is to balance long-term exposure with income-generating assets governed by the DAO.

**Phase 3: Tokenization and Maturity**\
In this phase, the market will have priced in most of the growth potential of established players. The treasury will increasingly focus on Machine RWAs that are owned by the DAO, with revenue flowing on-chain and governed by DEUS holders.

This is where Machine DeFi emerges as a key unlock. Productive machine assets, such as autonomous vertical farms can serve as collateral for on-chain lending, allowing the DAO to access liquidity without selling long-term positions.

Phase 3 represents the full realization of XMAQUINA’s mission: a decentralized, self-governed machine economy built around co-ownership, co-creation, and co-governance.

Throughout these phases, the treasury will dynamically adjust to industry trends, community governance decisions, and market opportunities, ensuring alignment with the DAO’s mission.

<figure><img src="https://3845795905-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fet8WTC8isg8YGzzdTqga%2Fuploads%2FfkPzxXPjrh1DvWBJIkkF%2FHigh%20Level%20Architecture%20(4).png?alt=media&#x26;token=49be464e-6482-46fa-832e-5f45fc80a738" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Crypto Yield Allocation

The DAO treasury includes components designed to generate on-chain yield through decentralized protocols.

#### **Yield-Generating Components**

• **Liquid Crypto Assets:** A portion of the DAO’s liquid crypto holdings may be staked or deployed in decentralized exchanges or DeFi protocols to generate ongoing yield.

**• Stablecoins:** Utilized in DeFi strategies to generate passive returns and maintain operational flexibility.

**• Liquid DEUS Tokens:** A portion of the DAO’s DEUS holdings may be allocated to liquidity pools to support deep liquidity and token availability across major ecosystems, while generating yield for the DAO.

**Allocation Strategy**

During the accumulation phase, yield generated from DeFi protocols will be converted into stablecoins to strengthen the DAO’s liquid reserves. These reserves will be used to expand the DAO’s exposure to robotics companies and mission-aligned tokens.

The goal is to increase the amount of robotics equity and DePAI tokens held within the DAO treasury.

Initially, crypto yield will be split: 50% will remain in the DAO Treasury to acquire additional assets, and 50% will flow to the Profit Bucket, governed by DEUS token stakers. The community may vote to allocate these funds toward DEUS buybacks or staking programs, initiatives benefiting DEUS holders.

### Machine-Generated Yield

The DAO’s real-world machine assets generate revenue in fiat currency through commercial operations. While denominated in fiat, this machine-driven economic activity is brought on-chain in a permissionless and decentralized way.

### Yield Source

**Machine Real-World Assets:** Examples include vertical farms, robotic cafés, and autonomous service machines. These systems operate in real-world environments, generating revenue through product sales, usage fees, or subscriptions.

**On-Chain Conversion and Distribution**

Fiat-denominated yield is made on-chain using decentralized infrastructure such as [bridge.xyz](https://bridge.xyz), which enables conversion to stablecoins and execution of distribution via smart contracts. This process ensures that off-chain revenue is transparently routed to the DAO in a fully decentralized, trustless manner, without reliance on centralized intermediaries.

During the accumulation phase, machine-based yield will follow the same structure as crypto-based yield:

• 50% will flow to the DAO's Treasury in stablecoins and used to expand exposure to robotics companies and mission-aligned assets.

• 50% will be directed to the Profit Bucket, governed by DEUS stakers. The community may vote to use these funds for DEUS buybacks, staking programs, or other on-chain mechanisms that benefit token holders.

The goal remains to increase the amount of robotics equity and DePAI tokens held within the DAO, while accruing value to the DEUS token and stakers.


# The Machine Economy Launchpad

## The Launchpad & SubDAOs

The Launchpad is a community-owned, decentralized infrastructure layer that enables the creation of SubDAOs. These are independent, asset-specific DAOs with their own governance, assets, and operating models. Built on XMAQUINA’s legal and technical frameworks, the Launchpad allows decentralized organizations to hold real-world machine assets, own equity in robotics companies, and coordinate capital for the deployment of Physical AI.

Scheduled for release in Q1 2025, the Launchpad will provide communities and builders with seamless entry into the machine economy, all within the XMAQUINA ecosystem.

<figure><img src="https://3845795905-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fet8WTC8isg8YGzzdTqga%2Fuploads%2FlTS79XBju8blcjXpY8GP%2FToken%20Structure%20%20(1).png?alt=media&#x26;token=07f2a355-d2ba-408a-bcc2-cc64aa65bca0" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### **Examples of Launchpad Use Cases**

**Private Market Access SubDAO**\
A community could launch a SubDAO to coordinate and secure a structured allocation in Engine AI, a robotics company based in China. Through the Launchpad, contributors seeking exposure to the company pool resources into the SubDAO, which collectively manages the participation process. Members receive tokens representing their share in the SubDAO, granting coordinated governance rights over the position. This model enables collective access to high-barrier opportunities and facilitates transparent, on-chain governance of the underlying exposure.

**Machine RWA SubDAO**\
Let’s start with an example featuring one of our partners: iFarm. iFarm provides full-stack technology for automated vertical farming, offering everything from white-labeled infrastructure and proprietary software to farming products and operational management. Their innovative subscription model includes finding and training a local farm manager, allowing the entire farming operation to be managed efficiently with minimal friction.

Using the XMAQUINA Launchpad, a community could form a SubDAO to fund and co-own a vertical strawberry farm powered by iFarm in a region like the UAE, where demand for locally grown, premium produce is rising. Global interest in this space is accelerating, with major players like Plenty and Alpha Dhabi committing over $680 million to vertical farming projects in the region \[[source](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/us-startup-plenty-alpha-dhabi-plan-us680-million-vertical-farms)]. The SubDAO would hold the underlying machine asset and receive the revenue generated from produce sales. Token holders could govern operational decisions, reinvest profits, or distribute to members, all through transparent on-chain governance.\
\
This model lowers the barrier to entering capital-intensive industries and makes high-performing machine assets accessible to a broader community. It can be extended to other Machine RWAs such as autonomous mobility fleets, drone farming systems, and even one day fleets of humanoid robots, enabling real-world income streams to be coordinated, owned, and governed collectively.

**Key features include:**

**• SubDAO Formation:** Projects can launch dedicated SubDAOs with custom governance rules, operating logic, and clearly defined goals based on their asset or mission focus.

• **Capital Coordination:** The Launchpad enables on-chain fundraising, modeled after the Genesis Auction, allowing communities to transparently pool resources to support robotics deployments and asset acquisition.

**• Asset Ownership and Tokenization:** SubDAOs can hold and manage Physical AI assets, such as deployed robots or equity exposure, and may issue their own tokens representing ownership, access, or revenue participation.

• **Integration with Core Infrastructure:** While independent, SubDAOs can access shared XMAQUINA resources including legal templates, development tooling, DeFi infrastructure, and can submit funding proposals to the main DAO.

### Launchpad Fees and Allocation Strategy

Each SubDAO launched through the Machine Economy Launchpad contributes value back to the XMAQUINA DAO through a structured fee model. These fees are designed to strengthen the DAO’s treasury and support its long-term strategy of accumulating mission-aligned assets.

**Fee breakdown:**

**• 5% of SubDAO Tokens Issued:** Allocated to the XMAQUINA DAO treasury.

**• 5% of Capital Raised During SubDAO Auctions:** Collected as a service fee and directed to the treasury.

All fees flow directly to the DAO, reinforcing its ability to continue acquiring strategic assets. This structure ensures that each SubDAO launch strengthens both its own mission and the shared foundation of the broader XMAQUINA ecosystem.

The deployment of the Launchpad is expected to bring new capital into the ecosystem, driving growth and accelerating innovation. This milestone will attract a diverse range of participants including developers, researchers, operators, and end-users, helping to build a vibrant community around decentralized robotics.

# Execution Engine

The team who executes what the DAO decides

The executing engine has a critical role within the DAO. It manages all the projects that allows the DAO to make progress and move to its next steps. The way the Execution Engine relates to the DAO is the way democracy should work : The DAO members decide, the Execution Engine executes.&#x20;

The Execution Engine is in charge of:

* **Deal Sourcing:** Identifying and evaluating high-potential opportunities in robotics, DePIN, and related sectors. This involves conducting in-depth market research and sourcing investments from secondary market brokers. They have to deal with the complexity of receiving information from third parties who are willing to sell assets and presenting deals to the DAO members while respecting requirements from the third parties.&#x20;
* **Legal:** Ensuring all operations adhere to applicable laws, regulations, and tax requirements, safeguarding the DAO’s integrity.
* **Tokenomics & Incentives:** Refining the DEUS token’s economic framework, including creating mechanisms to incentivize meaningful contributions and support long-term sustainability.
* **Governance:** Supporting the evolution of governance processes by promoting transparency, fairness, and proposing updates for community voting as the DAO grows.
* **Comms & Ops:** Managing day-to-day operations, coordinating workflows, driving awareness, and overseeing communication and marketing efforts to grow and engage XMAQUINA’s community while enhancing the DAO’s visibility and impact.
* **Treasury & DeFi:** Developing strategies to manage volatile assets, proposing DeFi strategies for treasury growth, and ensuring transparency in financial reporting to the DAO.


# Scoring Committee

The scoring committee is a group of Advisors tasked with assessing proposals.

<figure><img src="https://3845795905-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fet8WTC8isg8YGzzdTqga%2Fuploads%2FGAsamjjHESpEcuhHypmf%2F68418a116aad203ebcf56cd1_scoring%20committee.png?alt=media&#x26;token=60652da6-c3b9-40ab-a957-085e1536a9c6" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The scoring committee is composed of industry experts, including leaders from the venture capital, robotics, and decentralized technology sectors and who are tasked with assessing proposals for Physical AI and Web3 projects.

By providing expert insights and a structured scoring process, the committee ensures that resources are allocated to the most promising projects. Their work includes drafting detailed memos prior to voting, equipping the DAO with the information needed to make well-informed decisions.

Read more about the DAO's advisors [here.](https://app.gitbook.com/o/BYd7jR9Wl78LJfgtfkNu/s/et8WTC8isg8YGzzdTqga/)&#x20;

## Role of The Scoring Committee

They evaluates proposals, drafts memos, advises on developments, and offers strategic recommendations. Their main function is to analyze proposals in depth, checking for potential risks and benefits that might not be obvious at first glance. This analysis gives the broader community the details they need when casting votes on which projects should move forward.

The scoring committee does not decide anything, it provides insights and advises. Ultimately, it is the DAO members, i.e. members who are staking their DEUS that are able to vote and decide collectively.&#x20;

## Evaluation Process

When a proposal comes in, the committee reviews the goals, budget, and timeline, along with any open-source components or data-sharing methods. They also consider how well each project lines up with the long-term vision of physical AI and decentralized robotics. The committee might assign a score based on a set of criteria that might include innovation, technical feasibility, and community impact. A higher score typically means the project has demonstrated a strong aligment with the mission of the MachineDAO. &#x20;

## Looking Ahead

As XMAQUINA expands, the scoring committee and the community will continue to refine its evaluation methods to keep pace with new developments in AI and robotics.&#x20;


# DEUS Labs

# Token Utility

## Your Stake In Physical AI

The DEUS token is the coordination layer that powers the entire XMAQUINA ecosystem. It grants holders voting rights over the DAO’s treasury and strategic direction, enabling collective ownership of Physical AI.

By staking DEUS, members participate directly in decisions around capital allocation, project funding, and the launch of new SubDAOs. This ensures that the ecosystem remains aligned with the community’s priorities while maintaining transparency and decentralization through on-chain governance.

Value generated from asset appreciation, successful exits, machine operations, the launchpad, SubDAO activity, and DAO incubations flows back into the ecosystem. Governance can allocate these proceeds to token burns, staking rewards, or other approved initiatives, ensuring transparent distribution in line with the priorities of DEUS holders.\
\
This creates a flywheel where those who stake, build, and govern are rewarded for their contributions as the machine economy grows.&#x20;

## DEUS Token Utility

* **Governance Rights:** DEUS grants holders governance rights over the DAO’s treasury, allowing them to vote on key decisions, allocations, and overall strategy. This empowers participants to actively shape the DAO’s future direction.
* **Value Distribution Governance:** DEUS holders govern how value generated across the ecosystem is distributed. This includes outcomes from machine operations, SubDAO activity, and successful exits. Governance participants can propose and vote to direct this value toward token burns, staking programs, or treasury growth, ensuring that value created by the DAO is distributed transparently and in alignment with the community’s priorities.
* **Multi-Asset Treasury Exposure:** Gain exposure to the collective governance of a treasury filled with previously inaccessible opportunities, including equity in private robotics companies, strategic Physical AI assets and tokenized intellectual property.
* **Token Supply Governance:** The DAO may implement strategies to promote sustainable tokenomics and long-term value alignment, which may include supply adjustments, token buy backs, token sales, and other measures benefiting DEUS holders.
* **Incentives:** Active DAO members who complete bounties, contribute to DAO units, or support ecosystem growth can earn token rewards, encouraging long-term engagement and meaningful contributions.
* **DAO Initiatives:** The DAO may deploy tokens in DeFi to generate additional value and support growth. Governance can decide how this value is directed.

# veToken Model

Proven in leading DAOs, built for XMAQUINA

To take part in governance and share in the value created by the XMAQUINA ecosystem, DEUS holders stake their tokens in a vote‑escrowed model called xDEUS. Inspired by successful designs such as Curve Finance’s veCRV, this approach rewards long‑term commitment and active contribution while addressing key legal and operational requirements.

<figure><img src="https://3845795905-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fet8WTC8isg8YGzzdTqga%2Fuploads%2F6tWEEX9n4WzZjCGyXc3R%2FToken%20Structure%20%20(1).png?alt=media&#x26;token=fdd6c00f-1d5c-42ea-8b01-71a42d98ed29" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### How It Works

**• Time-Based Staking**

DEUS holders lock their tokens for a fixed period to receive non-transferable xDEUS. The longer the lock, the more benefits. This increases both governance power and eligibility for rewards, encouraging sustained participation over short-term speculation.

**• Governance Power**

xDEUS holders govern the DAO. They vote on treasury strategy, SubDAO approvals, capital allocation, and ecosystem upgrades. Influence is directly tied to long-term commitment, ensuring that those most aligned with the mission shape its future.

**• Economic Alignment**

Locked tokens are removed from circulation, reducing liquid supply and helping stabilize the token economy. This model discourages volatility and strengthens the foundation for sustainable growth.

**• Governance Filtering**

Only staked DEUS counts in governance. This naturally filters out inactive or speculative holders, concentrating decision-making power in the hands of active participants who are aligned with the mission and incentivized to steward the ecosystem responsibly.

### **Why It Matters for XMAQUINA**

In a capital-intensive sector like Physical AI, long-term, mission-aligned governance is essential. The xDEUS model ensures that those who govern the system are committed to its success. It also unlocks a compliant, transparent mechanism for distributing value to contributors, creating a flywheel where staking, governance, and ecosystem growth are mutually reinforcing.


# DEUS & Treasury NAV

This section explores the relationship between the market capitalization of the DEUS token and the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the XMAQUINA DAO treasury.

## **The relationship between the DEUS Market Cap and the Treasury NAV**

While DEUS is anchored by a growing portfolio of real-world assets, its market value may also reflect the broader potential of the ecosystem. Governance rights, strategic reach, and access to emerging sectors like private robotics contribute to dynamics that extend beyond simple asset backing.

This pattern is not unique to crypto. In traditional markets, the value of a share often represents future potential, strategic positioning, and network strength in addition to the underlying assets.

### Case Study: MicroStrategy (Strategy Incorporated)

MicroStrategy, now operating as Strategy Incorporated, provides a helpful comparison. As a publicly traded company holding large amounts of Bitcoin, its market capitalization has consistently exceeded the value of its BTC holdings. As of the latest data, its market cap-to-NAV (mNAV) multiple is approximately 2.7.

### **Why does this premium exist?**

Some analysts argue that a company’s market cap should match the value of its holdings. However, this theory doesn’t hold up in practice. The premium has persisted, indicating other factors are at play.

**Premium Justification**

Others point to MicroStrategy’s structure as a bridge for new types of participants such as bond traders and equity investors, who want exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding it. The company’s instruments, like convertible bonds, attract capital from sources that otherwise can’t interact with crypto markets directly.

This dynamic allows MicroStrategy to issue additional shares, acquire more Bitcoin, and scale its asset base, creating a self-reinforcing flywheel.

## Applying This to XMAQUINA

XMAQUINA is building a treasury composed of robotics equity, DePIN and DePAI networks, Machine RWAs, and tokenized intellectual property. Like MicroStrategy, it offers access to a category of assets—Physical AI—that are otherwise difficult or impossible for most participants to reach.

However, DEUS provides additional advantages beyond what traditional wrappers like MicroStrategy offer:

**• Liquidity**

DEUS is a tradable, permissionless digital asset which will be available 24/7 on global markets. In contrast, robotics equity, early-stage tokens, or physical machines are typically illiquid and require long holding periods. DEUS gives participants exposure to these assets while preserving flexibility and optionality.

**• Global Investment Reach**

Robotics innovation is accelerating rapidly in both United States and China, two of the world’s leading hubs for humanoid and industrial automation. Yet cross-border investment is heavily restricted. U.S. investors face barriers to accessing Chinese robotics ventures, and vice versa.

XMAQUINA DAO is not bound by these limitations. As a globally coordinated entity, it can allocate capital across regions, unlocking access to high-impact opportunities regardless of jurisdiction.

The DAO is also not limited to the U.S. and China. It can engage with robotics ecosystems in Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and beyond, building a diversified, borderless portfolio that traditional structures can't match.

**• Democratized Access**

Physical AI and robotics are capital-intensive sectors traditionally dominated by venture funds, corporate investors, and closed networks. Regulatory requirements, minimum check sizes, and geographic constraints often exclude individuals and smaller entities from participating.

DEUS removes these barriers by enabling anyone, anywhere, to gain exposure to this vertical. Through decentralized ownership, global participants can co-own and benefit from the value created by this emerging asset class and the rise of Physical AI.

If DEUS trades at a premium to NAV, such as a 2.5x multiple, the DAO can strategically allocate a portion of its DEUS holdings to acquire additional robotics equity, mission-aligned tokens or Machine assets. This enhances the asset base, reinforces long-term alignment, and creates a feedback loop between community participation, market value, and treasury strength.

### **Disclaimer**

This section is not financial advice and does not include price predictions. DEUS may trade at a premium, discount, or parity to the DAO’s NAV based on market sentiment, ecosystem performance, and external conditions. This is a conceptual framework for understanding potential dynamics, not a forecast.


# Governance Overview

Evolving participation, growing decentralization

DAO governance is an ever‑evolving process. Before TGE, we operate with a simplified governance framework to move quickly and establish core structures. Post‑TGE, we will introduce Governance V2 with expanded tools and processes. The goal is to progressively decentralize decision‑making, ensuring that over time control shifts fully into the hands of the community.


# Governance V1: Pre-TGE

## Introduction: Governance V1

XMAQUINA’s initial governance structure is designed for efficiency and agility in decision‑making while maintaining transparency and decentralization. This simplified framework, using the currently non-transferable DEUS token, enables rapid iteration and contributor‑driven innovation through proposals submitted by the Northstar Council.

At the token generation event (TGE), Governance V2 will replace this model, combining on‑chain execution with a vote‑escrowed (veToken) system. It will also open proposal submissions to DAO members, further decentralizing control as the organization matures.

### Initial Governance Model

In Governance V1, the Northstar Council subDAO submits proposals to the main DAO for a standard voting process. All DEUS holders with vested DEUS tokens can participate in these votes.

**Voting Process:**

1. **Proposal Creation:** The Northstar Council drafts and submits a proposal to the DAO on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.xmaquina.io/#/).
2. **Voting Period:** Voting remains open for 3 to 5 days, with the duration set according to urgency and any external timing constraints such as broker deadlines or allocation requirements.
3. **Quorum:** For a proposal to pass, at least 1% of the total liquid DEUS tokens eligible for voting must participate.
4. **Outcome:** If quorum is met and a majority votes in favour, the proposal is approved and moves to execution.

### Governance Phases

#### Phase 1 - Ideation & Allocation Research

The ideation phase focuses on identifying and prioritizing potential treasury allocations.

Community discussions on Discord, the forum, and in working groups lead to deep‑dive research reports and analysis on potential targets. To guide the Execution Engine’s deal‑sourcing efforts, the DAO may hold weighted Snapshot votes where members rank companies for allocation. Top‑ranked companies become the primary sourcing focus, with alternatives considered if access constraints arise.

This process ensures allocation decisions are based on research, community input, and transparent prioritization.

***Example:*** The DAO's first [Snapshot prioritization vote](https://snapshot.xmaquina.io/#/proposal/0x7467b69c6bbf74965cf884609560d29e27ae95365b06f36623f56bba9e2cc118) ahead of a Genesis Auction.

**Phase 2 - Draft Proposal & Scoring Committee Review**

When the Execution Engine secures a potential deal with one of the top‑ranked companies from Phase 1, it is formalized into a detailed allocation proposal. This proposal includes the allocation amount, terms, strategic rationale,  potential liquidity events, and timeline.

The Scoring Committee, composed of industry experts, reviews the deal and provides its assessment, including strengths, risks, and a recommended course of action. Their input is added directly to the proposal so DAO members have both the execution details and an independent expert view when it proceeds to voting.

***Example:*** [Allocation proposal for 1X Technologies](https://snapshot.xmaquina.io/#/proposal/0xac863bfe9d3d5f1b997501d9d5261b84bfa4a0cde0bd3426323770fae8e83c17).

#### Phase 3 - Proposal Submission & Voting

Once the allocation proposal is finalized with all details and the Scoring Committee’s assessment, the Northstar Council submits it to the DAO for voting on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.xmaquina.io/#/).

Voting remains open for 3 to 5 days, with the duration set based on urgency and any external timing constraints such as broker deadlines or allocation requirements. A quorum of 1% of total liquid DEUS tokens eligible for voting must participate for the vote to be valid.

If quorum is met and a majority votes in favour, the proposal is passed.

#### Phase 4 - Execution

When a proposal passes, the DAO’s Execution Engine carries out the approved deal or allocation and manages its ongoing operations. This includes:\
\
• Finalizing contracts and compliance with the intermediary\
• Coordinating legal and treasury operations for the transaction\
• Documenting the transaction flow with a transparent paper trail for auditability

All treasury activity and asset positions are tracked for DAO‑wide visibility on the [DAO Portal](https://dao.xmaquina.io/).

### The DAO's Three Week Governance Cycle&#x20;

While governance actions generally follow the same phases, timing is flexible and depends on the complexity and urgency of each proposal.

<figure><img src="https://3845795905-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fet8WTC8isg8YGzzdTqga%2Fuploads%2FeUtokTzEFriQgsiEldBq%2FToken%20Structure%20%20(2).png?alt=media&#x26;token=23135b82-5c3b-424b-aac6-8376df105493" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Week 1 (Day 1-7):** Community Ideation & Research
* **Week 2 (Day 1-7):** Proposal Drafting & Scoring Committee Review
* **Week 3 (Day 1-5):** Proposal Submission & Voting
* **Week 3 (Day 5+):** Execution Phase

### Transition to Governance V2

At the token generation event (TGE), the DAO will transition to Governance V2, introducing a vote‑escrowed (veToken) model. This upgrade will allow all members to submit proposals and will further decentralize decision‑making as the DAO grows.


# Governance V2: Post-TGE

When the token generation event (TGE) arrives, so does Governance V2. It will mark a major upgrade in how the DAO makes decisions, rewards members, and moves at the speed of opportunity.

* **xDEUS is Coming:** DEUS holders will stake their tokens to mint xDEUS, the XMAQUINA ecosystem’s veToken. xDEUS grants governance rights and unlocks access to protocol rewards.
* **Power Grows Over Time:** The longer DEUS remains staked, the higher the voting power and reward multipliers a member unlocks, increasing both their influence and earning potential.
* **Introducing Optimistic Dual Governance:** Governance V2 introduces an agility layer within governance through OPX proposals. This fast-track mechanism allows trusted DAO units like the Northstar Council to execute time-sensitive actions. Each OPX proposal includes a time-lock period, giving xDEUS holders the ability to veto. The result is a system that balances speed with decentralization and accountability.

<figure><img src="https://3845795905-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fet8WTC8isg8YGzzdTqga%2Fuploads%2FHDjyxuXGC5DOCBs0uEwp%2FToken%20Structure%20%20(2).png?alt=media&#x26;token=4d530f11-89b6-47bb-ad91-2a259af04114" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

With xDEUS at the center, Governance V2 opens up a new era of participation, long-term alignment, and protocol rewards for members. Full details on the vote escrowed model, staking mechanics, and governance flows will be released ahead of launch.

The Machine DAO will be established as a DAO LLC under the laws of the Marshall Islands, it will be a member-managed organization recognizing the holders of the DEUS token as its members.

### 2. Key Acknowledgments

By agreeing to this declaration, the Participant acknowledges the following:

* The mission and vision of the Machine DAO;
* The proposed corporate structure of the MachineDAO in the form of a non-profit Marshall Islands DAO LLC.
* The DAO governance framework and its decentralized decision-making mechanisms.
* The formation and authority of the initial DAO committees, including the Northstar Council and Deus Labs.
* The role of the XMAQUINA Foundation (the “Foundation”) in the Initiative and DAO formation process.

### 3. Machine DAO

The Machine DAO is envisioned as an organization of persons willing to participate in the Initiative or contribute to its purposes and objectives. The Machine DAO will be established as a DAO LLC in the Marshall Islands substantially in line with the following process:

1. Genesis Auction:\
   Public announcement and invitation for participants to join the Initiative by purchasing the DEUS tokens through the DEUS Token Genesis Auction.
2. Receipt Token Event:\
   Initiation of the Machine DAO through the initial distribution of the non-transferable receipt tokens, enabling the claim of the DEUS tokens at a later stage. Until the DEUS tokens become claimable, the receipt tokens will enable Initiative participants to take part in the Initiative-related signalling votes.
3. TGE & Operational Launch:\
   The Machine DAO becomes fully operational once the DEUS token is deployed, with governance and resource allocation mechanisms active.
4. DAO LLC Formation:\
   Incorporation of the Machine DAO as a non-profit Marshall Islands DAO LLC. The Foundation agreed to facilitate the formation process.
5. Treasury Formation:\
   Formation of the Machine DAO treasury.
6. Committee Formation:\
   Initial DAO committees, such as Deus Labs and the Northstar Council, are established and allocated resources to execute their strategic objectives.
7. Foundation Subordination:\
   The Foundation is formally subordinated to the Machine DAO, ensuring alignment with the decentralized governance.

### 4. Vision and Mission

Although the mission and vision of the Machine DAO may be further expanded, presently, the core mission and vision are to:

* Expand access to previously inaccessible opportunities, including private robotics companies and tokenised intellectual property in physical AI;
* Enable open, ethical innovation through decentralised governance and community collaboration;
* Promote robotic automation technologies, open machine economy, development of robotic products and solutions, decentralised robotics ecosystems, and associated technologies;&#x20;
* Drive the adoption of growth of Decentralised Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) for large-scale autonomous systems.
* Empower communities to co-create and co-govern value generated by the robotics economy.
* Build a future where physical AI serves humanity as a shared public good.

Learn more about the Machine DAO’ mission and vision in our [public documentation](https://xmaquina.gitbook.io/xmaquina).

### 5. Governance Processes

The key components of the Machine DAO governance process include:

* #### Member Management:

Machine DAO is a member-managed organization, with DEUS token holders playing the central role in its governance and decision making. All major decisions within the DAO require member approval, with members being able to vote on governance proposals, veto proposals, and guide the DAO’s activities, development, and evolution.

* #### veToken Model:

The governance relies on the veToken (vote-escrowed token) system to align long-term incentives. To gain voting power within the DAO, the members need to stake the DEUS tokens in the governance smart contracts. Upon staking, the members mint non-transferable xDEUS tokens, entitling members to participate and vote in Member votes. The amount of xDEUS minted depends on both the number of DEUS tokens staked and the staking duration, encouraging long-term commitment to the DAO’s objectives.

* #### Optimistic Dual Governance:

The governance framework incorporates the Optimistic Dual Governance plugin from the Aragon OSx stack, enabling an efficient and flexible decision-making process. This plugin will be active during a 24-month period following the DEUS deployment. It enables the Northstar Council, relying on the authority delegated by the DAO members, to act swiftly on strategic initiatives while ensuring accountability to the community. DAO members retain the right to veto or reject any proposals submitted by the Northstar Council through the Member votes. [Learn more about Optimistic Dual Governance](https://blog.aragon.org/optimistic-dual-governance-a-new-governance-design-leveraging-aragon-osx-plugins/).

* #### Northstar Council:

Composed of the DAO member delegates, the Northstar Council oversees the DAO’s strategic direction and ensures mission alignment. During the early stages, it is delegated with authority to submit proposals for Member vote under the Optimistic Dual Governance procedures, enabling quick adaptation to opportunities and challenges.

* #### Foundation:

The Foundation is an independent unit within the Machine DAO ecosystem. Its purposes align with the vision and mission of the DAO, and its role is expected to include holding, managing, and protecting IP and goodwill, contributing to the mission and purposes of the Machine DAO, and engaging in certain other transactions on an as-needed basis.

Learn More About the DAO’s Governance Processes

The governance process includes stages such as ideation, proposal drafting, Snapshot voting, and on-chain decision-making. For a detailed explanation, visit the[ Governance Section](https://xmaquina.gitbook.io/xmaquina/overview/governance) in our documentation to learn more.

### 6. DAO Committees

At the outset of the Machine DAO’s operations, two key committees will be established under the Machine DAO LLC structure. These committees will serve distinct roles in advancing the DAO’s mission, ensuring focused execution of critical objectives while maintaining alignment with the broader governance framework.

**(1) Deus Labs Committee**

Purpose:\
\
Deus Labs Committee is delegated by the DAO members with authority to function as the DAO's in-house development lab, focusing on the incubation and funding of Physical AI projects. This committee is designed to drive technological innovation and accelerate the development of robotics and decentralized infrastructure within the broader Machine DAO ecosystem.

Key Details:

* Token Allocation: Deus Labs will be allocated 7.5% of the DEUS token supply.
* Independent Management: Managed independently by the Deus Labs Committee within the DAO-granted mandate, this allocation ensures that the lab has the resources to actively fund R\&D and incubate Physical AI projects.

**(2) Northstar Council Committee**

Purpose:\
\
The Northstar Council Committee is delegated by the DAO members with authority to oversee the operational and strategic direction of the DAO during its formative stages, driving adoption and growth.

Key Details:

* Fund Allocation: The Northstar Council Committee will be allocated 8% of the assets contributed by the participants to the DEUS Token Genesis Auction. This will be in the form of the Genesis Auction funding tokens.
* Management Structure: Assets allocated to the Northstar Council will be secured through a multisig wallet and managed independently by the Council’s member delegates within the DAO-granted mandate.

Responsibilities:

* Overseeing the DAO’s direction and long-term strategy to ensure it is aligned with the DAO’s missions and purposes.
* Driving growth and adoption of the DAO.
* Partaking in organizing DAO units and committees.
* Providing leadership for key initiatives and scaling the ecosystem.
* Overseeing the development of DAO products, such as “MachineDAO Portal,” “DAO AI Agent,” and “Machine Economy Launchpad”, in alignment with the public DAO roadmap.

# Community Genesis Auction

The genesis auction will seed the XMAQUINA DAO in multiple auction waves.

## Seeding The DAO

The Deus Genesis Auction is the way the DEUS token is distributed to the community. It is designed to distribute ownership of DEUS to the public while bootstrapping the DAO’s treasury ahead of the DEUS token becoming transferable.&#x20;

This initiative aims to establish the DAO by building a diversified multi-token treasury to support funding, governance, DeFi liquidity strategies, and ecosystem incentives.

30% of the total DEUS token supply is allocated to the Genesis Auction, structured as an open on-chain community launch. Unlike the current standard in crypto, which often reserves a large portion of the supply to Venture Capital backers, this auction ensures equal terms for all participants.&#x20;

A total of 71% of the DEUS token supply is dedicated to the XMAQUINA community.

<figure><img src="https://3845795905-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fet8WTC8isg8YGzzdTqga%2Fuploads%2F7QJiiQlHT2WrTQOwEFja%2FScreenshot%202025-01-17%20at%209.59.09%E2%80%AFAM%20(1).png?alt=media&#x26;token=30c5d0da-ac2c-4398-ab2a-28157e5ecc8d" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The final Genesis allocation will be determined by factors such as wave valuations, market demand, and prevailing conditions. By prioritizing broad participation, the auction seeks to build a strong, engaged community of stakeholders and lay the groundwork for decentralized governance from the start.

## Auction Format

The Genesis Auction will proceed in successive waves. During each wave, participants can exchange select eligible tokens such as ETH, BTC, USDC, and DePIN or DePAI related tokens for receipt tokens representing their future DEUS allocations. The selection of eligible tokens may vary across Genesis waves, enabling the DAO to strategically build a diversified treasury of strategic assets.

### Receipt Tokens

Upon participating, contributors will receive non-transferable receipt tokens, which provide two key benefits:&#x20;

1. **Token Claiming:** Receipt tokens can be redeemed for DEUS in line with their respective vesting schedule through the [DAO Portal](https://app.gitbook.com/u/dpBqGKDb8UQYhYtgTG5wsvTWipU2).
2. **Meta-Governance:** Auction contributors can immediately participate in early governance, influencing foundational DAO decisions through voting.

## Auction Pricing and Participation

Each wave will feature a fixed swap price based on market averages and strategic considerations to ensure transparency and fairness. The vesting schedule and swap rates for each wave will be announced prior to its start. Details for Wave 3 of the Genesis Auction will be shared mid September 2025.

## Why a Community Auction?&#x20;

To ensure equitable access and prevent manipulation:

* **Participation Caps:** Certain waves may limit the amount that can be contributed per address to ensure fair access for all participants.
* **Diversified Treasury Goals:** The DAO will strategically structure swaps to build a robust and balanced asset portfolio aligned with long-term objectives.

This structured auction design provides multiple benefits:

* **Transparency:** Clear value exchange adds confidence in the process.
* **Stability:** Fixed pricing and market-based strategies smooth out fluctuations, ensuring fairness for participants.
* **Community:** Equal terms and open access create a stronger, more engaged community of stakeholders.

## Claiming Your Tokens & TGE

Details about the claiming process will be announced in May.

* **Token Claim:** The claiming process is explained in [this blog](https://app.gitbook.com/u/dpBqGKDb8UQYhYtgTG5wsvTWipU2) and completed through the [DAO Portal](https://genesis.xmaquina.io/portfolio).
* **TGE:** The Token Generation Event date will be shared shortly after the final Genesis Auction concludes.

<figure><img src="https://3845795905-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fet8WTC8isg8YGzzdTqga%2Fuploads%2FkxNEZW9aOrQwtnUrUobg%2F1737447717917.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=9d9cc4fb-8e7f-46d9-8c47-766d1a80abe9" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## **Part 1. Getting Ready to Participate**

### **1. Connect Your Wallet**

The first step is to connect your metamask wallet. Start by clicking the connect button at the top right corner of the genesis auction website. Base is an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. Ensure eligible tokens are on the Base Network.&#x20;

The Genesis Auction portal only supports Metamask and Coinbase wallet.

### Setting up a Metamask Wallet

To add Base as a custom network to MetaMask:

1. Open the MetaMask browser extension.
2. Open the network selection dropdown menu by clicking the dropdown button at the top of the extension.
3. Click the **Add network** button.
4. Click **Add a network manually**.
5. In the **Add a network manually** dialog that appears, enter the following information for Base mainnet:

   | Name            | Value                                                 |
   | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
   | Network Name    | Base Mainnet                                          |
   | Description     | The public mainnet for Base.                          |
   | RPC Endpoint    | [https://mainnet.base.org](https://mainnet.base.org/) |
   | Chain ID        | 8453                                                  |
   | Currency Symbol | ETH                                                   |
   | Block Explorer  | <https://base.blockscout.com/>                        |
6. Tap the Save button to save Base as a network.

You should now be able to connect to the Base by selecting it from the network selection dropdown menu.

### Setting up a Coinbase Wallet

The [Coinbase Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coinbase-wallet-extension/hnfanknocfeofbddgcijnmhnfnkdnaad?hl=en) browser extension provides support for Base by default.

To use Base with Coinbase Wallet:

1. Open the Coinbase Wallet browser extension and log in to your account.
2. Connect to an app using Coinbase Wallet.
3. Open the network selection menu by clicking the network icon in the upper right-hand corner.
4. Select **Base**.

Your active network should now be switched to Base.

### **2. Fund Your Wallet with ETH for Transaction Fees**

You will need ETH to interact with the Base network. Every transaction on the Base network has a transaction fee that must be paid in ETH. This fee is referred to as a ‘gas’ fee.

The Base network is cost-effective, so you won’t need much ETH tokens to pay for transactions.

### **3. Fund Your Wallet with USDC**

To participate in the auction, you will need **Bid Tokens**. Those are the tokens that are eligible and can be used to acquire DEUS receipt tokens.&#x20;

Wave 1.5 will use USDC tokens exclusively. Ensure you fund your wallet with the necessary USDC tokens to participate.

More token options will be offered in subsequent waves.

## **Part 2. Acquiring Receipt Tokens via Swap**

### **1. Explore Auction Status and Live Info**&#x20;

On the Genesis Auction website (genesis.xmaquina.io), you can check the status of the latest auction right on the homepage. The auction will consist of multiple waves, with as many waves as needed to sell all the Genesis Auction allocated tokens. We expect the auction to conclude within 3 to 4 total waves.

You can sign up to receive email notifications about the start of each auction wave. While each wave is expected to last about two to four weeks, high demand may cause a wave to close in a much shorter time period.

For updates, you can also join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/xmaquina), follow us on [X](https://x.com/xmaquinaDAO) and enable notifications to stay informed.

### a. Token Genesis

Subject to these T\&C, by participating in the Genesis Auction you may purchase a certain number of Tokens, if and as may be made available to you. The Token parameters, features and other information regarding the Tokens may be further outlined in the Materials, provided, however, that the Materials are provided for information purposes only, are subject to change without further notice or liability, and do not form a part of these T\&C.

### b. Our Rights

We reserve the right at any time, acting at our sole and absolute discretion, to (i) limit the number of Tokens available for sale, and establish a minimum or maximum number of Tokens that can be purchased by one Genesis Auction participant; (ii) limit the number of the Genesis Auction participants; (iii) establish and introduce certain Participation Requirements and other restrictions in relation to the Genesis Auction, including indicating specific Virtual Assets that can be used to purchase the Tokens; (iv) sell the Tokens by any means, other than through the Genesis Auction Page, including through other venues and platforms, and on different terms including more favourable ones; (v) sell Tokens during specific time periods (waves) with Wave Terms varying from one another (potentially becoming less favourable), modify the number of waves by increasing or decreasing their number or parameters, or cancel any wave; or (vi) otherwise change the parameters and terms of the Genesis Auction at any time without notice and any liability whatsoever.

### c. Participation Requirements

To participate in the Genesis Auction, you may be required to fulfil all applicable Participation Requirements within the specified timeframe, if any. We will determine, at our sole discretion, whether these Participation Requirements have been completed correctly and on time. Our decision will be final and cannot be disputed by you. If you fail to meet the Participation Requirements to our satisfaction, you may not be allowed to participate in the Genesis Auction or your participation may be cancelled.

### d. Purchase of Tokens

The Genesis Auction may be conducted in multiple waves, each with its own Wave Terms. Wave Terms, including pricing, lock-up and unlock schedules, may vary between waves. The Genesis Auction or any specific wave may have a limited duration. If you do not complete your purchase and all applicable conditions within that timeframe, your right to buy Tokens will automatically expire and terminate. To purchase Tokens, you must transfer the respective amount in the designated Virtual Assets during the applicable period, as instructed on the Genesis Auction Page. Only the designated Virtual Assets may be used for payment; any unapproved Virtual Assets sent by you will be disregarded by us, forfeited and permanently lost, in which case we shall not be responsible for their loss or recovery, or any losses and damages sustained. Certain time periods indicated on the Genesis Auction Page or otherwise communicated by us may depend on events within the underlying blockchain network, such as block additions or block height; in such cases, the specified times and dates are provided for informational purposes only, and the actual timeline shall be determined by the relevant blockchain events. The actual timeframes may be determined and enforced by the applicable Smart-Contracts or by us manually.

### e. Restrictions Applicable to Tokens

The Tokens purchased during the Genesis Auction may be subject to Restriction Terms outlined on the Genesis Auction Page, through applicable Smart-Contracts, or otherwise provided before, during, or after the Genesis Auction. Restriction Terms may differ between participants based on the wave in which the purchase occurs. We may set or change these Restriction Terms at our sole discretion, at any time, without notice or your approval, and without any liability, provided that such changes apply equally to all participants of the relevant wave. These Restriction Terms may differ between categories of purchasers and could include conditions such as lock-up and unlock restrictions, gradual token release over time or in particular instalments. The Restriction Terms are a key part of your Genesis Auction participation and may be programmed into applicable Smart-Contracts or relevant software. Ensure you fully understand all applicable Restriction Terms before participating in the Genesis Auction. The Wave Terms applicable to your wave, as well as the respective Restriction Terms, may be less favorable compared to other waves. You may choose the wave in which you participate while taking such restrictions and other applicable terms into consideration. We reserve the right to set, modify, or update Wave Terms at our sole discretion, at any time, without notice or approval, and without any liability.

### f. Token Distribution

Depending on the applicable Restriction Terms, all or part of the Tokens will not be available to you immediately after the purchase. After sending the purchase amount through the Genesis Auction Page or other permitted means, if and as applicable, your Wallet will be assigned a Claim Token (or relevant number of Claim Tokens, if and as the case may be). The distribution of Tokens can be facilitated through relevant Smart-Contracts, which you hereby accept. To receive the purchased Tokens, you may be required to manually claim them from the respective distribution Smart-Contracts with a Wallet that is assigned to the Claim Token. The Tokens will be delivered to the distribution Smart-Contracts and will become available for claim as per the applicable Restriction Terms and Wave Terms, based on the wave during which the Tokens were purchased. It is your responsibility to monitor announcements related to the distribution of the Tokens, including in the Communication Channels, and to claim the Tokens according to the applicable Restriction Terms and Wave Terms, and within the applicable timeframes. The Claim Token is non-transferrable, therefore you shall be required to use the same Wallet that contains the Claim Token to claim and receive the Tokens. The claiming period may be limited in duration, and if you fail to claim the Tokens within the relevant period, the unclaimed Tokens shall be forfeited and lost; provided, however, that we may, at our sole and absolute discretion, decide to manually deliver the Tokens to your relevant Wallet or a configured Smart-Contract permitting further claim and distribution, although we are under no obligation to do so. All and any of our obligations relating to the purchased Tokens or their distribution to you shall end with the Closing. We shall not be responsible for any failure or inability on your part to claim or withdraw the purchased Tokens from a properly configured Smart-Contract.

### g. Ownership and Refunds

When you transfer Virtual Assets to the applicable Smart-Contract in connection with your participation in the Genesis Auction, you relinquish ownership of the transferred Virtual Assets. You shall be deemed the owner of the Tokens only once and if you received them to your Wallet in accordance with the terms hereof. Your rights to participate in the Genesis Auction and purchase the Tokens shall be personal and non-transferable, and shall always be subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. To the maximum extent permitted under the law, any purchase of the Tokens in the Genesis Auction shall be final and non-refundable. All our obligations concerning the Genesis Auction and sale of the Tokens to you shall be considered fulfilled and fully performed upon the Closing.

### h. Compliance Checks

To participate in the Genesis Auction, you may be required to complete Compliance Checks, which we can require at any stage — before, during the Genesis Auction, or before the distribution of the purchased Tokens (whether to the Smart-Contract or directly to you). The Compliance Checks must be completed within a timeframe specified by us. Access to the Genesis Auction or purchased Tokens may be suspended or withheld until the Compliance Checks are successfully completed. We are not responsible for your inability to access, claim, or receive purchased Tokens if you fail to complete the Compliance Checks or meet the applicable requirements. If you fail to successfully pass the Compliance Checks, we may refuse to distribute the Tokens. In such a case, unless otherwise prescribed by the applicable law, we may refund the payment you made to the same Wallet from which it was sent or such other address, if and as may be agreed with us. We are not responsible for any delays, losses, or technical issues arising from such a refund process. Compliance Checks may be conducted by a Third-Party Service provider acting on our behalf, which is hereby accepted by you. You must provide accurate, complete, and true information during or in connection with the Compliance Checks. The decision on whether you have passed the Compliance Checks will be made solely at our discretion, is final and cannot be disputed by you.

## 4. Wallet

### a. General

In order to participate in the Genesis Auction, you shall connect your Wallet through one of the compatible third-party software wallets. The Wallets and any software wallet solutions constitute Third-Party Services, and we are not responsible for, do not endorse, and cannot be held liable or responsible in connection therewith. We do not make any warranties, whether express or implied, as to the Wallets and software wallet solutions used by you in connection with the Genesis Auction. When using Wallets and software wallet solutions, you should review applicable terms and policies that govern your use thereof.

### b. Security

Neither we nor the applicable Smart-Contract receive access to or control over your Wallets or Virtual Assets held in such Wallets. You are solely responsible for securing your Virtual Assets, Wallets, and Wallet Credentials. You should not disclose your Wallet Credentials to any third person nor allow any third person to access your Wallet. You will be solely responsible for any use of your Wallet, and Wallet Credentials, as well as their confidentiality. You remain responsible for all transactions carried out via your Wallet or using the Wallet Credentials.&#x20;

## 5.  Smart-Contracts&#x20;

### a. General

The Genesis Auction operates through certain Smart-Contracts. Although the Genesis Auction Page provides an interface to interact with the Smart-Contracts, the Genesis Auction Page is distinct from the Smart-Contracts which constitute independent software. Further details about the Smart-Contracts may be outlined in the Materials, provided, however, that the Materials are provided for information purposes only and do not form a part of these T\&C. Access to, use of, and any other interaction with the Smart-Contracts shall be subject to such rules, limitations and restrictions as implemented in the respective Smart-Contracts. In the event of any discrepancies between the terms set forth herein and those programmed into the applicable Smart-Contracts, the terms of the Smart-Contracts shall govern and prevail for transactions conducted on the blockchain, and the terms set forth herein shall govern and control in all other circumstances.

### b. Disclaimer

The Smart-Contracts are deployed on public blockchain networks that operate in a decentralised and autonomous manner. The Smart-Contracts may be open-source, meaning anyone can review, verify, use, copy, modify, or distribute them, subject to the applicable licence terms. You are responsible for thoroughly reviewing and assessing the Smart-Contracts and related software before using them and must conduct your own independent research before making the purchase decision. We do not control or operate the underlying blockchain networks or the software through which such networks are formed. Therefore, we are not responsible or liable in connection with the Smart-Contracts’ underlying blockchain networks or related software, and their operation, functioning, or use. You accept all associated risks, including potential losses or damages resulting therefrom.

## 6. Term and Termination&#x20;

### a. Term

These T\&C will be in full force until terminated in accordance with the terms prescribed herein.

### b. Termination

You shall not have the right to terminate these T\&Cs without our prior consent. We may reject and terminate your participation in the Genesis Auction at any time with or without reason, and without notice and any liability whatsoever, in which case all our obligations on the sale, transfer, and distribution of the Tokens shall immediately cease and be of no further effect. If the termination occurs before the Closing, depending on the ground of the termination, you may be entitled to a refund for any undistributed Tokens, provided that the final decision on any refund shall be made by us at our sole discretion, given the circumstances of refund, and further provided that the refund, if any, shall be made to the same Wallet you have used to participate in the Genesis Auction. These T\&C shall be deemed automatically terminated upon the occurrence of the earliest of the following events: (i) termination of the Genesis Auction by us; (ii) termination or cessation of your participation in the Genesis Auction; or (iii) the Closing.

### c. Survival

The terms “investment”, “investor” and other similar terms, as may be used in the Materials, if any, are not meant to be interpreted literally. Rather, such terms are being used to draw rough, fuzzy-logic analogies between the heavily automated and mostly deterministic operations of decentralised smart-contracts and the discretionary performance of traditional off-chain transactions by people. When using smart-contracts, there are no legal agreements, promises of payment, or courts of law, and therefore there are no investments or other traditional transactions involved.

## **Schedule 1 : Risk Disclosure Statement**

## 1. General Blockchain Risks

### a. Irreversibility

Please note that transactions on a public blockchain are irreversible. We do not and cannot control or influence transactions with Virtual Assets and, therefore, are not able to cancel, reverse, block, or freeze any transactions on a blockchain network. You must independently assess risks and make informed decisions before carrying out any transactions. We do not warrant that transactions will be executed with the gas fees you expect or that they will be executed at all, including because of high network demand.

### b. Autonomy of Infrastructure

Blockchain-based infrastructure operates autonomously and is typically beyond anyone’s control. Any malfunction, breakdown, or abandonment of the underlying blockchain could significantly impact the Project, Tokens, or related Virtual Asset transactions. You are responsible for conducting thorough research before engaging with the Tokens.

### c. Privacy and Data Risks

Blockchain data is publicly accessible and traceable by third parties, meaning transactions in Virtual Assets may expose certain information about you, though it is unlikely to directly reveal your identity. However, when combined with other personal information, it may allow third parties to infer your financial standing. Once recorded, blockchain data cannot be altered or deleted, making the decision to transact entirely your responsibility.

### d. Risk Associated with Hard Fork

A hard fork in the underlying blockchain network of the Tokens, or any of its components, could require major changes. These changes might make the Smart-Contracts incompatible, dysfunctional, impractical, or more expensive to use. This could disrupt the execution and interaction of Smart-Contracts critical to the Genesis Auction. Adapting to a hard fork or changes in consensus rules may require significant time and resources, which might not be available or cost-effective. Consequently, the Project continued operation cannot be guaranteed.

### e. Risk Associated with Cryptography Development

Advances in cryptography and technology, particularly quantum computing, could threaten blockchain systems by weakening or breaking the cryptographic consensus mechanisms that underpin them. As quantum computing evolves, algorithms once considered secure may become obsolete, leaving systems that rely on traditional cryptographic methods vulnerable. This could allow intruders to bypass existing security measures, compromise data integrity, as well as disrupt consensus mechanisms on blockchain networks.

## 2. Financial and Market Risks

### a. Risk of Loss&#x20;

Transacting with Virtual Assets involves the risk of monetary or other losses. These risks can arise from various factors, including market volatility, vulnerabilities in Smart-Contracts, cybersecurity threats such as hacking or phishing attacks, technical failures, regulatory changes, etc. Unforeseen events, including economic downturns, changes in market sentiment, etc, could also have a material adverse effect on your assets.

### b. Virtual Assets’ Value Risks

In general, Virtual Assets are not backed by any physical assets and do not have any intrinsic value. We make no representations or warranties, whether express or implied, regarding Virtual Assets, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. These are expressly disclaimed. You acknowledge that: (i) we do not warrant any inherent value with regard to Virtual Assets; (ii) there is no assurance Virtual Assets will gain value, will hold any particular value or price, or have any value at all; and (iii) we make no promises about future performance or value with respect to Virtual Assets, their price, supply amount, etc. Purchasing, storing, using, or disposing of Virtual Assets is entirely at your own risk.

### c. Volatility Risks

Purchasing, using, or holding Virtual Assets involves significant risks. The crypto market is highly volatile, and prices can change drastically in short periods, potentially leading to substantial or total loss of your funds. Due to the nature and operation of blockchain protocols, the total amount of Virtual Assets in circulation could increase through, inter alia, the adoption of a new patch, upgrade of the source code, or additional mint. In no event shall we be responsible for or held liable in connection with any damages or losses that you may incur as a result of or in connection with the change in the composition, supply, value or price of any Virtual Assets. You are solely responsible for evaluating these risks, making informed decisions, and bearing any consequences, including losses. Only allocate funds to Virtual Assets that you can afford to lose.

### d. Liquidity and Market Risks

There is no assurance that an active market will exist now or in the future for buying or selling Virtual Assets. Their price and liquidity cannot be assured, and it is possible that there may be no market or liquidity for Virtual Assets at all. In some cases, they may become useless or abandoned entirely. Specifically, we make no assurances that the Tokens will be listed on any exchanges, that a market for the Tokens will exist or develop, or that their prices will remain consistent across different platforms.

## 3. Risks Associated with Project

### a. Project Pivot

The design, essence, particulars and description of the Project, including related products and services, may be amended or changed at any time without notice. There is no assurance that the Project will be developed, operated or maintained for any particular time period or at all. The Project may be pivoted at any time. Nothing in the T\&C or Materials imposes an obligation to develop, deploy, launch, promote, or operate the Project, the Token, or any related products or services.

### b. Public Interest Uncertainty

Public interest in the Project is not warranted, and low user engagement may negatively impact its development and associated business activities.

### c. Risk of Confusing Interface

The user interface, design of the Project or associated infrastructure may sometimes cause confusion, leading to unintended actions or transactions, such as selecting the wrong Virtual Asset, transaction type, blockchain network, or account.

### d. Risk of Unofficial Projects

There is always a risk of alternative projects or competing teams, including those creating similar products or forking (cloning) the Project and its associated software or components, which could negatively affect the Project. Additionally, you may be targeted by fraudulent activities, including fake websites, emails, text messages, or social media accounts impersonating us or the Project. They may aim to deceive you, steal your Virtual Assets, or otherwise profit unlawfully. Exercise extreme caution when interacting with websites, emails, text messages, and social media accounts, directing you to sources other than the official Project-associated websites or applications, or those asking you to connect your Wallet. Always verify the authenticity of any communication claiming to represent the Project.

## 4.  Technological Risks

### a. Functionality and Flawed Logic of Software

The Tokens and associated technical infrastructure are provided “as is” and may experience system failures, downtimes, unplanned interruptions in their underlying network or functionality, hardware or software defects, security breaches, or other causes that could adversely affect the Tokens or your access to them. We are not obligated to address these issues and do not warrant that any updates will resolve existing bugs or vulnerabilities, or avoid creating new, unanticipated issues.

### b. Software Weaknesses, Bugs and Vulnerabilities

The Tokens-related software, including Smart-Contracts, as well as underlying logic of blockchain networks for Virtual Assets may contain weaknesses, flaws, bugs, vulnerabilities, defects, or impairments. This can cause the software or Smart-Contracts to operate incorrectly or not as expected, potentially resulting in transactions being executed contrary to their intended logic or your intents. Such issues can lead to the partial or complete loss of Virtual Assets involved in a transaction or other adverse outcomes.

### c. Lack of Remediation

The software and Smart-Contracts may contain errors or vulnerabilities that are not immediately apparent. Addressing these issues can be challenging and may not always be effective. Additionally, many Smart-Contracts are immutable by design, meaning they cannot be modified once deployed. Efforts to remediate flaws, defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in blockchain software may be disruptive, risky, complex, expensive, and time-consuming. There is no warranty that such efforts will succeed in preventing adverse outcomes, including the potential complete or substantial loss of your Virtual Assets transferred to any Smart-Contracts.

### d. Downtime and Maintenance&#x20;

The Tokens-related services, products, or their components may occasionally become inaccessible or inoperable for various reasons, including maintenance, updates, technical disruptions, or third-party interference. Such occurrences may lead to downtime or a lack of access to them. These interruptions could result in delays or cancellations of transactions, an inability to complete transactions, and/or partial or complete loss of the Virtual Assets involved in those transactions.

### e. Delayed Updates

There is no warranty that the software, including Smart-Contracts, the Project relies on will be updated quickly enough to address new threats, vulnerabilities, or required changes, or can be updated at all. Delays in updates can leave users exposed to risks such as errors, failed transactions, inability to execute time-sensitive operations, or the loss of Virtual Assets.

## 5. Security Risks

### a. Risk of Theft

The blockchain networks can be attacked which may result in downtime, consensus split, long reorganisation of the chain, 51% attack or other adverse outcomes. There is no warranty that there will be no theft or loss of Virtual Assets due to attacks, hacks, software flaws, or blockchain vulnerabilities, which could result in partial or complete loss of the Virtual Assets. Even when using our official resources, remain vigilant for pop-ups or unusual program behaviour, as these could result from hacks or malicious code.&#x20;

### b. Exploitation of Vulnerabilities

Bugs, flaws in logic, and other vulnerabilities are not part of the intended operation of the Project-related software and Smart-Contracts. However, intruders may exploit these weaknesses or flaws, potentially causing financial losses, data breaches, or system malfunctions. The exploitation of bugs, flaws, or vulnerabilities in Smart-Contracts or associated software is strictly prohibited, regardless of the purpose or circumstances. Such acts, especially those that harm other users, may be considered criminal or other offences under applicable laws and could result in severe consequences for those involved.

### c. Risk Associated with Credentials

If a third party gains access to your Wallet or its Credentials, they may control and use your Virtual Assets held in such Wallet. To reduce this risk, secure your electronic devices or systems (both hardware and software) used in relation to the Wallet and/or Project, as well as the Credentials against unauthorised access. We encourage you to properly back up all Credentials associated with your Wallets used in connection with Genesis Auction and the Project.

Interactions with third parties carry risks, including fraud, insolvency, contract breaches, or security failures, which could result in the loss of your Virtual Assets.

### c. Third-Party Illegal Behaviour&#x20;

Due to the nature of permissionless blockchain software, there is a risk that the Project or its components could be misused by third parties for illegal activities, such as fraud, etc. Such misuse could result in legal and regulatory consequences affecting the Project’s operation and development. While we cannot control users’ actions, any misuse could expose us, the Project, and its users to lawsuits, government investigations, or other enforcement actions. These consequences may lead to liability and reputational harm for us and Affiliates, potentially disrupting the Project operation, hindering its development, and negatively impacting our business activities.

### d. Inaccurate Data

The Project and its infrastructure may rely on and derive certain information from third-party data sources in an automated manner, such as oracles, third-party APIs, etc. This information is not manually verified or checked, and as a result, it may be incorrect, incomplete, outdated, inaccurate, or insufficient. In certain situations, immediate action may be required, and timely analysis of the available data is essential for making informed decisions. However, delays in the delivery of necessary information may occur, posing an inherent risk. The inability to act promptly due to such delays could result in partial or complete loss of Virtual Assets. You should always exercise caution when relying on any third-party data.

## 8. Regulatory and Compliance Risks

### a. Legal Uncertainty

The Project and related activities may be subject to various laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we operate or intend to operate, including obtaining different licences or other permissive documents, if so directed by applicable laws. Additionally, changes in applicable laws or regulations, or evolving interpretations of existing law could, in certain circumstances, result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures, which could affect the development, operation, and maintenance of the Project. In extreme cases, certain jurisdictions might even ban or severely restrict Project-related activities. Be aware that the legal status of Virtual Assets and transactions involving them remains uncertain, and some jurisdictions may impose full prohibitions on owning or transacting in them, which could apply to you. Penalties for any such potential violation would be unknown. You should independently research the legal implications of interacting with Virtual Assets, including all applicable tax requirements.&#x20;

### b. Taxation

Any acquisition, holding, use or disposition of Virtual Assets, as well as any transactions carried out in relation to the Project, may have tax implications for you as imposed by state or government authorities. Tax laws and their interpretations concerning Virtual Assets may be unclear or not well-defined in your jurisdiction. Additionally, current interpretations of tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and existing laws may be amended retroactively. You are solely responsible for understanding and fulfilling your tax obligations. Failure to properly collect, withhold, report, or remit applicable Taxes may lead to penalties, fines, or other legal consequences. It is strongly recommended that you seek professional advice to ensure compliance with all applicable tax requirements.

Transactions during the Genesis Auction are processed and recorded on applicable blockchain networks. Data recorded on blockchain networks is publicly accessible, meaning anyone can view information about blockchain transactions. While the Wallet Data, such as wallet addresses and transaction IDs, is not considered personal data or personally identifiable information on its own, it can become one when combined with other data. Therefore, certain particular individuals may be identified and their personal information may become publicly available. Additionally, blockchain networks are generally immutable, meaning that no one can modify or delete data once it has been recorded on the blockchain. Therefore, you, we, or any other person will not be able to correct or erase data recorded on the blockchain network. Therefore, certain privacy or data protection rights may be limited.


# Security & Audits

"Genesis Auction" Swap Contract and "DEUS" Token Contract Audit Reports:\
[Audit by Hashlock.](https://hashlock.com/audits/xmaquina)


# Decentralized Physical AI

## Physical AI

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems embodied in autonomous machines—such as robots or self-driving vehicles—that can perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI models that operate within digital confines, physical AI integrates spatial awareness and an understanding of real-world physics to interact seamlessly with its environment.

## The Role of DAOs in Physical AI

A decentralized autonomous organization acts as the governance layer that aligns incentives. XMAQUINA is an example of such a DAO, designed to fund and guide projects in robotics and Physical AI. By using smart contracts and transparent protocols, DAO members can decide how resources are allocated to promising ideas and research, all without relying on a handful of decision-makers. This structure keeps the process open, democratically managed, and easily auditable.

Bringing together the DAO model with Physical AI creates a community-driven ecosystem where humanoid robots and other AI-enabled machines can be built, tested, and improved collaboratively.&#x20;

This goes hand in hand with open-source and open data-sharing. The emphasis is on shared ownership and collective progress, where each participant has a say in which direction the technology moves.


# Genesis Auction

The DEUS Genesis Auction is the core mechanism to fund the DAO treasury

The DEUS Genesis Auction levels the playing field, breaking away from the typical VC-dominated model and enabling everyone to participate on equal terms. Designed to distribute ownership of DEUS to the public while bootstrapping the DAO’s treasury, this fair auction builds a strong, engaged community and lays the foundation for decentralized governance from the start.

## How The Waves Work

Each wave of the genesis auction has its own parameters, such as the token quantity available, the funding token or the duration of the sale. As each wave concludes, new participants receive receipt tokens, and join existing stakeholders, broadening the community.&#x20;

This incremental approach avoids the rush of a single event and helps prevent large swings in token ownership. By allowing multiple opportunities to join, it also ensures that a broader audience is aware of the XMAQUINA DAO.

## Why A Multi-Wave Auction

A multi-wave format lets people observe the evolution of the sale and make informed decisions before committing. This appraoch aims to create a steady, well-distributed base of token holders who believe in the DAO’s long-term vision and want to contribute to its growth.


# Staking and Voting

## Staking

Staking means locking up tokens for a certain period, signaling commitment to the DAO and its objectives. In the case of XMAQUINA, it is mandatory to stake DEUS tokens to acquire xDEUS voting tokens that are necessary to vote. To be a voting member of the XMAQUINA DAO, users need to stake.&#x20;

Beyond voting, members benefit from DAO initiatives such as DeFi and staking programs. Staking demonstrates a deeper level of engagement: those who stake have something at stake, motivating them to act in the organization’s best interest.

## Voting&#x20;

Once tokens are staked, participants can use their voting rights to influence the DAO’s decisions. This might include choosing which robotics and AI projects receive funding, setting rules for open collaboration, or shaping the development of the XMAQUINA ecosystem.

By allowing every staker to cast a vote, the system remains equitable and transparent. Proposals with the most support move forward, ensuring that decisions reflect the will of those who have demonstrated commitment.

## Benefits for Physical AI Development&#x20;

When it comes to funding physical AI projects, staking and voting help identify the proposals that are able to gather the most interest from the community. For example, if a proposal aims to improve humanoid robot designs, stakers can assess whether it aligns with shared goals, like promoting open-source robotics, advancing AI safety, or exploring new data-sharing methods. If the community agrees, the project receives funding and network support.&#x20;


# Web3 and Decentralization

## Decentralization

Decentralization shifts control and decision-making from a single authority to multiple participants. This structure reduces reliance on individual honesty or cooperation and prevents any single entity from wielding excessive influence. By design, it is more resistant to manipulation, enhancing robustness against attacks and external interference, while often improving service quality. However, dividing decision-making across multiple entities can slow transaction speeds, as there is no centralized authority for rapid approvals. Ultimately, the choice to adopt decentralization depends on whether its reliability and service advantages outweigh the potential inefficiencies.

## Benefits of Decentralization&#x20;

When a system is decentralized, it can function with minimal direct trust between members because everyone maintains a common, shared ledger. If someone alters their copy of the data, the majority can reject it as invalid.&#x20;

This architecture also streamlines how data is shared, because each party sees the same up-to-date information rather than relying on assorted, individual data silos. Removing singular control points lowers the risk of systemic failure, such as service disruptions or bottlenecks caused by one overloaded entity.&#x20;

Additionally, spreading resources helps distribute incentives more effectively, ensuring that services run smoothly and consistently. By tapping into a wide pool of participants and letting them collaborate efficiently, a decentralized environment can scale without creating too much overlap or financial drain.

## Drawbacks of Decentralization&#x20;

Despite its advantages, decentralization comes with challenges. Without a central authority, responsibilities can overlap, and coordination may take longer.

Reaching consensus among many groups can slow decision-making compared to centralized methods. These delays can result in slower responses and, in some cases, uncertainty about roles and leadership. While decentralization improves robustness and fairness, it often requires trade-offs in speed and clarity.

## Blockchain&#x20;

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions while using cryptocurrency to cover operational costs. Its chain grows continuously as verified blocks are added sequentially. Each block includes a cryptographic reference to the preceding block, a timestamp, and transaction details.

For example, nodes on the Bitcoin network use the blockchain to validate transactions and prevent issues like double-spending. This design ensures data integrity and trust without requiring a central authority.
